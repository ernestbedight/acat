It was clogged.
Did he try to snake it to clear the blockage?
He did, but there was too much stuff to get out with that method.
So what did he have to do?
He's coming back to suction it in an hour.
If that doesn't work then he'll have to open up the pipes.
I work on the computer.

What type of games do you play?
Card games mostly, but also hidden object games.

I will destroy you!
I'm a pillow fighting champion!
We'll see about that!
Where will we set up the fort?
Do you want to walk around the park?
No, the weather is too gloomy.
It's not that bad outside!

I appreciate it.
It's hard to keep track of all this!
I'm happy to help!
Hmm, what was that guy's name?
I didn't catch it either.
I think it started with an 'S'.
It might have been Shane.
I'll ask him to remind me next time I see him.
Good idea.
Shane or Sean, I think.
What is for dinner?
Whatever you're making for us, dear.
What do you feel like having?
Why do I have to decide?
OK, then I'll decide, but you have to promise not to wrinkle your nose when I tell you what I'm making.
Not a problem!

Today for about a 1/2 hour; for my life, about 12 years.

How did your vacation in California go?
My vacation was great, thanks!

We went into San Fransisco to do the usual tour stops!
You should have gone off the beaten path.
There's more to California than San Francisco.
Have you thought about checking out ghost towns?
Do cats like rain?
No.
Because cats hate to get wet.

Oh yes, that's wonderful.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
Did you go out last night?
No, I stayed in and ordered pizza.
Me, too!

That wouldn't work.
Well, it might!
can we discuss this once you are done reading?
Ok. We can discuss it after I finish reading.
How long do you think you will take?
I should be done in about 20 minutes.
Okay, I'l just sit here and stare at you	That's creepy, why not do something else instead?
Did you bring some new books?
Yes, I brought some new books.
Did you bring anything really good?
Maybe, depends on what kind of books you like to read.
I like to read the classics.
Do you have any?
I have some of the Bronte's novels.
I was mowing the lawn.
Wearing my shoes?

How interesting.
How does composting work?
It's not hard really.
I only download my shows over the internet.

I really enjoy Game of Thrones.
Never seen it, sounds stupid.
Why are you judging something you've never seen?
Me too, I hope you dont have to wait around all day
Is there anything fun to do that is also affordable?
Nothing around here.
Not even a movie or an ice cream parlor?
Movies are too expensive these days.
But we could get some ice cream   Is there a Bruster's around here?
No, but there is a Cold Stone right around the corner.
Why don't you carry cash?
Everything is a slide card now, where have you been?
Buying at small shops and food stalls, I guess.
Oh, I guess cash does come in handy sometimes, then.
I had nothing better to do.
I have something for you to do, I need help cleaning the garage today!
Oh I just remembered I have stuff to do.
BYE!
Yeah sure, you lazy bum.
You don't have to clean the garage today.
Sure, I would be happy to get that for you.
How much will it cost?
It's 50, but, I'll buy it for you.
Thanks.
You don't have to do that.
it's okay, no problem.
Could you stop that?
No, I like doing it  Well, could you keep it down, it's kind of annoying?
Put some earplugs in if you don't like it.
Okay stop doing it right now or you are grounded.
okay okay,don't get mad
Would you prefer the outlet instead of the inside mall?
Either one is fine with me.
I only got half of my allowance this week, that's why I want to go to the outlet.
OK, that is fine with me.
Can I borrow a pen?
Yes you can.
Do you have a red pen, by any chance?
No, only a blue one.
Blue one will do   Here you go.
Do you want to go the casino tomorow?
Sure, I have a new system I'm certain will work.
That's what they all say.
Which machine are you headed to?
The slot machines.
That's where I always go first.
Beware the one-armed bandit!
I only take $20 and play until it's gone.
It's ok. small town so not much to do.
Okay, please let me know once you hear something from him.
Why are you so curious for me to tell you that?
Well it concerns me, too.
What is all this about?
What time is dinner?
I can't be bothered to cook.
Are you just going to get take-out when you get hungry?
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling like.
Want to get some chinese food?
Sure, I'm hungry now!
Can I please have a look?
You can take a quick peek.
Where did you find that?
It was in the garage.
Ewww gross, what are you going to do with it?
I'm going to eat it.
When did you come in the room?
I came in a few minutes ago.
And what happened then?
I set down my purse, and that's when the doorbell rang.
Why were you in my room in the first place?
I was coming to say hi after a long day.
No need to be defensive.
Kids still doing well in school?
Yes, Kristen made the honor roll and decided she wants to be a veterinarian.
Ethan is loving his art classes.
Smart and ambitious, these kids are going places!
To be honest, I'm a little worried about Ethan's math grades, but he has been working really hard and I think he's starting to improve.
Why are you cold?
I am always cold  Do you need me to turn the air conditioner off?
Maybe just turn it down.
I don't want to inconvenience everyone else.
Or I could bring you a sweater.
no just turn the ac down a bit
What is your favorite movie?
I have a hard time choosing just one.
Right now I really enjoy Deadpool and Star Wars Force Awakens.
What did you like about Deadpool?
I heard it was a bunch of uninspired humor.
I really like the characters.
Well the main actor is very cute.
Wade Wilson or shall I say Ryan Reynolds is not my type but the detailing and the graphics of his action moves were phenomenal.
Yes, he did.
I wonder why he did that.
He's such a jerk.
I'm sorry he did that to you.
It wasn't the first time but I can promise it will definitely be the last, I'm done.
Can you fill out my tax declaration?
Yes I will do it later on tonight.
Sorry for the rush!
Not a problem at all.
I appreciate your help very much.
Thanks.
Not a problem!
Well I thought I'd surprise you.
I wish you had told me sooner.
If I had told you sooner, it wouldn't have been a surprise.
But next time, I'll let you know so you can bake me a cake.
Are we there yet?
We should be there shortly.
Are there yet now?
Johnny, stop.
You know we aren't there yet.
I'll tell you when we're getting close.
Are we there yet?
We're turning around next time you ask.
How much homework do you have tonight?
Way more than I want.
I've been letting it slide.
This is what you get for procrastinating!
Want to do them together?
No, I'm all caught up with mine.
Sorry!
No problem.
How long did it take you to finish it?
Cool, I'll clear the driveway so there's room for you to park.
Don't worry, I'll be riding my bike!
Call when you arrive and I will open the garage for you to put your bike inside.
What did she say?
She said she never even got a message from you.
What's the deal?
the deal is that I've been sick.
So, you lied to her about sending her a message?
Not really, I intended to, but things got in the way.
what actually happened?
Does she have any friends?
More than I could ever imagine.
Are most of her friends females?
No, they're mostly men.
Better keep a close watch on that one.
Beauty, brains, and athletic abilities just draw the men to her.
I know, the struggle is real.
Do I know you?
No.
Not at all.
I'm pretty certain we've met.
Maybe we went to school together?
No, I think it is from somewhere else.
Well I don't seem to recall ever meeting you.
Where Is a good place to eat?
In the restaurant near the lake.
What type of cuisine is it?
It is Mediterranean.
Do they have Happy Hour?
I am not sure, you may have to call them.
Sunny with a chance of rain.
Means it for sure will rain.
It probably won't rain, unless you forget your umbrella.
I hope it does rain then I won't have to water my plants.
We have a sprinkler system that does that.
Would you please warm up my food?
Sure, I'll put it in the microwave     Thank you very much, that's kind of you.
Anything else I can get you while I am up?
Can I get a glass of water, please?
yes, let me get some.
Would you want to eat again?
Maybe later, my stomach's not feeling up to it.
Are you ill?
Just a little nauseous.
Okay, I hope you feel better soon.
Thank you for your concern.
Could I please speak to a manager?
Yes, M'am.
I'm the manager.
I want to file a complaint.
I'm so sorry for your trouble!
What happened?
I ordered a grilled cheese but was served a cheeseburger.
I'm very sorry this happened.
Let me correct that for you.
I do not play a instrument.
Too bad, latest study says people who play instruments live longer.
Maybe I'll take up the piano.
Good idea.
I'll take up the tuba and we can start up a band.
Super.
I'll look up when the next American Idol auditions are for us to try out.
I bought a new pair of shoes from Amazon, and a book by David Foster Wallace.
How much did it cost?
About thirty dollars for the shoes and twenty dollars for the book.
I started reading it and I don't much like it, though.
That's unfortunate.
What is the book about?
It's 200 pages long and only pictures of Wallace's childhood.
Where is my phone?
I think I saw your phone on the kitchen counter.
I already looked there.
Oh, maybe it was the bathroom counter then.
I wasn't in the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
I guess I haven't seen it then.
What made you say that?
It just slipped out.
Well now you're in trouble.
What are you going to do about It?
Nothing, I think your wife already suspects and it won't be long till she calls you on it.
Oh no, you're probably right.
Yes, do you want cream and sugar?
Yes, please, plenty of both.
I like lots of cream and sugar too!
It's the only way I can drink it.
okay, lots of cream and sugar.
who did you go with?
I went with my husband and children.
Was the place children-friendly?
Yes, it was absolutely child-friendly.
Did they have lots for the kids to due?
they had an array of exciting things like games, face painting, and even some kiddie rides.
It is 10:30 AM.
Oh gosh, it's still morning?
That's what AM means.
I feel like it has been 3 hours since I got here!
The day does seem to be going by extra slow today.
Oh, I went to Mrs. Miller and got my money.
Did you get it all?
Yes, finally.
Now I can afford a new car!
That must have been a lot of money!
It is enough for a down payment.
Next week somebody will move in.
Do you know who it is?
I think a college student.
Oh great, hopefully they're not the partying type!
I don't think so, because the home is owned by the pastor and his wife, and I'm sure they would screen for quiet students.
Why is George crying?
He stubbed his toe Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine in a few minutes.
Yeah, he's a bit of a drama queen.
Yeah, he cries all of the time!
At least you aren't having to deal with him.
It's a fruit.
No, it is an delicious, exotic meat from Nigeria.
Wrong, steak is a delicious meat, avocado is a fruit.
I know; I was just kidding.
Avocado is a fruit and a member of the berry family, in case you didn't know.
How was your day?
Dull as dishwater.
How about yours?
Better than your apparently.
Yes, I would say so.
I think we need to spice up your life.
Me too, but between work and the kids' activities, I barely have time for myself.
I want to learn a lot and do some networking!
Great!
Would you like to sign up for any panels?
Absolutely I would!
You are so enthusiastic!
Is this your first time here?
Yes, how could you tell?
I'm not sure, I just found it by the door.
Well let's open it!
But it's not addressed to us.
Who is it addressed to?
what is the address?
Where do you put your case?
In its case.
A case inside a case?
Sorry I practice safe hygeine and don't want germs infesting my class schedule the way yours is.
Can you call my mother?
Sure, do you know her number?
I will have to look It up	      Okay, let me know when you find it.
Why don't you have your mother's phone number?
She changed it recently.
come on then	 You could be nicer about it.
I will just try to go, myself.
I'm sorry, I was trying to be encouraging.
It's just that today hasn't been one of my better days.
That happens to everyone.
Where is the book store?
It's at the mall.
On which wing of the mall?
Malls can't fly silly!
I guess I asked the wrong person; what an idiot!
I was just kidding!
So whats the plan tomorrow?
The plan is not to die.
You sound prepared, man!
Well, I'm doing the best I can.
Right, you can never be too sure these days.
Exactly, so besides staying alive, did you have any plans for tomorrow?
Yes, you were a year ahead of me.
Maybe you were a year behind me.
I was, you were in the same class as my cousin  Can you get the facts right?
You are very clever aren't you?
How was your day?
It's was alright.
We had a meeting at work about the new owners.
Did your company get bought out?
Yes, and the merger isn't going too well so far.
Im very sorry.
At least my boss has given us his word that no one will be fired.
I'll be back in two weeks on the 8th.
Care to stop by before you leave?
Sure, will you be home on Sunday afternoon?
Until 11, I have a brunch planned.
I see, how about Sunday evening?
Can you work overtime?
Not today sorry	 Are you available to work the weekend then?
I can work on Sunday if that helps.
Great, I need someone on Sunday from 9 to 9.
Will I get paid money or can I take an extra day off?
What kind of music do you like?
I love classical music especially the piano.
Who is your favorite composer?
Chopin, of course.
And you?
For me it is batobin   I've never heard of Batobin, tell me more about their work!
Could you please put in the air conditioner?
Sure, I can install it tomorrow.
Did I stutter, I mean now	Maybe you should install it yourself or ask Fred to do it.
Fred has pneumonia.
He can't do it.
Well you have 2 hands of your own so maybe you should do it and drop the attitude.
What's in the big box on the table?
I got your sister a present and am going to wrap it up.
It's already wrapped up.
Are you forgetting things again, Mom?
Oh, I'm sorry.
There were just a few things running through my mind.
So what is the present?
Its one of the juice machines you see on tv all the time.
Do you think it went well?
I think it went as well as it could have.
What could have been better?
It could have been a little shorter.
How long did it take?
A little too long for my comfort.
So when you turn sixteen are you going to go for your driver's license?
Yes I just can't wait!
Aren't you scared of driving?
Of course not!
I was terrified of driving when I was your age.
You were my age?
He's hilarious.
You're going to love him.
Cool, let's have some fun!
I think you're a little too eager to go.
The sooner we go for the tests, the sooner we can get started on making a baby.
I am a little nervous; aren't you?
Of course I am!
Do you know where it is?
It's on the dresser in your bedroom.
Why is it in my bedroom?
Oh man, that sounds awesome, what was the water like that day?
Huge waves bright sun it was awesome	Wow, I would love to visit there!
we can go this summer.
Can I have some wine?
Here is your glass.
Thanks so much.
What do you think of the wine?
it is so tasty       Oh, do you have some cheese and crackers?
Can you check my eBay account?
Sure, what do you want me to look at?
I need to know if anyone bought anything.
Sure, what's your eBay name?
It's under Mittens510.
I don't see any recent transactions.
What will be the color?
The color will be red.
What kind of red, bright or deep?
A bright red, I guess.
What do you mean by a deep red, though?
You know, like a dark red.
Deep is more like burgundy, right?
You are so brave and strong to lift 15 shirts up to find that one.
Why thank you, and you are very clever and beautiful to have noticed my manly strength.
What color blanket is on your bed?
Depends on how long the cats have been sleeping there.
Before the cats have been laying on it.
I can't even remember, possibly turquoise.
Too bad you don't own Russian Blues.
You think they would go well with my possibly turquoise blanket?
I have, but they didn't even work.
So even with the tablets you threw up all over the boat?
Yeah even taking some motion sickness tablets.
I mean it helped a little but I still felt sea sick.
Which country are you from?
I'm from the United States of America.
You're very lucky, then.
I guess so.
I haven't really thought about it.
You should certainly think about.
There are so many benefits.
Perhaps you're right.
I will look into that.
Can we go to bed?
No.
We have too much work to do.
I just hope we can finish it before my favorite show comes on!
We will never finish the work in time.
Not with that attitude we won't.
Well, we'll have to work more efficiently at lest.
Did you see that play?
Yes, it was terrible.
That's good to know because I was thinking about going to see it sometime.
Don't bother, it's not worth the ticket price.
I'll probably just go to the casino instead.
Do you want to come?
Yeah.
I love slot machines.
Shall I drive or will you?
You can drive.
OK, can we take your car?
No, I just got it washed and it looks like it's gonna rain.
Where is my blue shirt?
You're wearing it, Dan.
Time to get your eyes checked, buddy.
Oh haha, maybe I should get them checked!
Are you colorblind?
No, I just can't see blue, green, red or yellow.
That's being colorblind, Dan.
Would you pick up the book for me when you go?
Sure just text me in case I forget.
You forget everything.
I will text you.
About what?
I've already forgotten.
Ha ha very funny, anyway it is the book by Stephen King.
What is the title?
Stephen King has a lot of books.
What time is it now?
Time you got a watch.
I wish I have one but I don't!
You really should get a watch, man!
I'll go buy one tomorrow.
Well then you know it's the day before tomorrow, ha ha!

I don't live far from there!
You should come over sometime.
How about tomorrow night?
Awesome!

How was your day?
It was very good   Did you spend any time outside?
Not much, it was rainy.
What did you do, then?
I stayed inside and watched movies.
Could you fix this?
If I have some help yes Who should I call?
Nobody; I'm here to help any way I can.
So you're saying you're going to help yourself?
No, I only need you to help me with it.
When did you call me?
I called you this morning.
Don't ever wake me up at 5 am.
again  I'm sorry, I forgot about the time difference.
Well, always remember that I'm 2 hours behind you   I will, I'll try not to wake you up again.
No but I will finish it shortly.
Add eggs, please?
Sure!
Would a dozen work?
Yes, and don't forget the cream while you're at it.
Is there anything else you need?
What time is the movie?
The first showing is at 7:30.
Do you think we can still make it in time?
yes we just have to leave early.
Better hurry, then!
I want to get some popcorn before the show, too.
Yum!
Me, too!
What are your certifications?
I don't have any.
Are you going to try to get some?
Not yet.
I want to see how I do without them, first.
The job requirement specifically states that you need these certifications though.
I thought I could get by with my charm.
Where is the money you stored from last year?
I put it an a savings account.
That was smart of you.
I sure hope so.
I wish I had put my money into a savings account instead of spending it all.
Don't ask me for a loan, please.
I don't believe in lending money to friends.
Could you please help me find something to wear tomorrow?
Sure!
Let's go see what you have.
Have you seen my new closet redesign yet?
No, I don't think I have.
It's the best ever, I can find anything easily.
I d love to see it someday.
Yes, what can I help with?
I'm moving next Saturday.
Do you have a truck?
I've got a small pickup truck.
Are you moving a lot of stuff?
No, I just have few boxes of books and clothes.
Okay well tell me a time and I'll be there.
I don't really like Jack in the Box.
Can we go somewhere else?
Sure how about Taco Bell?
Oh yeah, I love their wraps.
I really like their crunch wraps
Where did you get that great purse?
I found it online.
Did you get free shipping?
I always do.
I have Amazon Prime.
It's not free if you pay $79/year for it.
But it does ensure the most I'll pay for shipping will be 79 dollars per year and I do order alot of things online with Amazon.
Can I get you a glass of water?
That would be great.
Do you want ice in your water?
No thanks, I like it warm.
Okay, coming right up.
Thank you.
You're so nice.
I also have a dog!
Cool I love dogs.
That's a great shirt where did you get it?
I got It at the mall.
How much was it?
It was $32 in the new store next to the theater.
Sweet.
Was that the regular price or was it on sale?
That was the regular price.
Well, we can't have cookies without milk!
Do we have cookies here?
Yes, chocolate chip or Oreos?
I like the idea of eating meat, but not of killing it.
Do you go fishing?
Yes, I love to fish.
Are these dishes clean?
yeah just done them Then why are there noodles hanging from that plate?
Because I didn't scrub hard enough.
Can you please clean them again then?
i guess so.
Are you feeling well?
No, I've been feeling sick for a while now.
Maybe you should go to the doctor.
Too hard to get an appointment.
I might head to the urgent care clinic.
I can take you if you want a ride.
Yes please.
I will feel much better if I had someone with me.
Can you bring that to me?
Of course, I'll be back soon.
Thanks so much!
You are very welcome.
Drive carefully, it's raining pretty hard out there.
I will take it nice and slow, thanks.
Where are my pants?
Sorry, I forgot to take them out of the Dryer.
That's fine, I'll get them.
I hope they're done.
Me too, I hate going to parties with wet pants.
If they aren't dry we can find something else for you to wear tonight!
Okay, here you go	 Thanks, do you have any ketchup?
No, just ranch.
Ok, ranch will be fine.
Here you go, Enjoy!
When will you be home?
sometime after six	 That's later than usual.
I know, I work to hard.
Is this for the extra project?
Yeah I've been working every detail to the t to make sure my boss is happy.
I think with all this hard work I just may get a promotion.
No time to enjoy it, that's for sure.
We work such long, tiring hours.
I know and unfortunately that's part of life  I think we should make some time to do something fun.
Hi!
I am the store's manager, how can I help you?
I'm looking for the salmon.
Sir, this is a book store.
Do you mean you want a book about salmon?
No, I need the actual fish.
Can you help?
Then go next door to the grocery store, I am pretty sure they can help you with that.
No, the book I'm looking for is called The Actual Fish.
Do you have it?
Do we have any cereal?
Yes in the back of the fridge     Why on earth is the cereal in the fridge?
I like it cool and it keeps it fresh longer.
Alrighty, we all have our quirks.
At least it's not as weird as yours where you like to drink sour milk.
Would you like me to get you two Motrin?
Yes, please.
I need to take some more.
Do you ever have to ask strangers to do that for you?
Do you know of any good places to eat?
Yes, I do.
It's a steakhouse.
I'm not a big fan of steak.
Do they do other things?
Yeah, but it's really a place for steak.
Maybe we can go someplace else?
Look at the menu first and see what they have.
What time Is the movie?
Stop yelling at me!
I can't help, It my volume Is stuck on max!
I'm not going to continue until you fix that!
It's really annoying when people shout at me!
Oh< Is It?
What you mean by yes?
To clarify, I mean the opposite of 'no'.
So you have always loved me?
Yes, I have always loved you.
Interesting, why didn't you tell me earlier?
Couldn't you tell by the way I acted?
Do you like her style of teaching?
I do, she's very inventive.
What kind of things does she do?
She makes up funny songs about things so they're easier for us to remember and we play lots of games.
Would you like to grab some coffee?
I am on my way to work.
How about tomorrow?
I can't do tomorrow, sorry.
How about Friday evening?
Busy.
Saturday morning?
We can find a place for brunch and take the whole family.
Could I get sugar in my coffee?
Sure, how many teaspoons would you like?
2 teaspoons please.
Don't you think that's sort of a lot of sugar?
What are you, a dietician?
No, but I really think that's too much sugar.
What's it called?
It's called Momma B's Cucina.
Oh, is that a new restaurant?
No, it's been around for ages!
Do you feel pain?
Yes!
It really hurts!
How bad is your pain?
On a scale of one to ten, it's a 4.
You have a very low pain tolerance, don't you?
Considering I have had 10 broken bones in my lifetime I would have to disagree.
Okay, sure, I'll find out and let you know.
I look forward to hearing back from you.
No problem shouldn't take me too long to find out.
It's been a while.
What did you find out?
They do ship to the UK and if you buy $100 or more shipping is free.
How old are you now?
Thirty-one and holding!
You don't look like you're 31 at all!
You're so kind.
No; I mean it!
I figured you for 26 max.
26?
Well, now you are just teasing me.
No problem,we didn't want you there anyway	Wow, what a nice thing to say.
i always say nice things   Yeah your a real charmer .
Who else caught the game last night?
I didn't get to see it because I don't have cable.
I am sorry to hear that because it was awesome!
Hopefully I get a chance to see the next game.
The next game is on tonight.
May be I can join you.
Well, what would be your best guess as to where she might be?
I can guarantee that she is most definitely not here.
I didn't ask you if she was there.
I just wondered if you knew where she might be.
No, I still don't know.
Why don't we call her cell phone?
I am very cold, will you get me a blanket?
Yes I will, just give me a minute.
I will die if you don't give it to me now!
Then get it yourself if you can't wait!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Yes I would.
Fancy coming to the gym with me after work?
No, because I have to meet with my kid's teacher.
Nothing bad, I hope?
The usual.
Nevaeh kept teasing Katie and pulling her hair, so Katie yelled at her to stop, and now for some reason Katie is the one in trouble again.
That's not surprising.
She may be learning aggressive behaviors from her sister.
I think you might be right.
Are you still enjoying your job?
Yes, they haven't completely stolen my soul yet.
How long do you think it will be until they do?
Weeks, I guess.
Months if they improve the quality of the coffee.
You could just bring your own coffee and save your soul.
You are right, but I prefer otherwise.
Can you call the doctor?
Yes I will, let me look up his number.
The number is 911, fool.
You said the doctor, not emergency.
Okay okay, sorry i'm just in a lot of pain!
That's okay.
Let's get you seen to!
Where did I park the car?
You parked it in Lot A  Shouldn't I have a slip for it?
No, this lot no longer uses slips.
They scan your eye remember?
Oh, I hate that.
It always makes me nervous.
It's the way of the future.
It's very hot today, don't you think?
Yes, it is very hot today.
I blame global warming.
That seems unlikely, but possible I guess.
Well it's a fact.
They say so in the news.
You can't believe everything you hear.
Do you want to bike ride together sometime?
Yes, tomorrow morning would be a great.
I'm busy tomorrow morning, how about in the afternoon?
Sure, the afternoon works too.
Prepare to sweat though!
I know, it's going to be a scorcher!
I know, supposed to be in the 100s tomorrow.
Okay, can I come with you?
No, I really don't want you to join me, sorry.
Why not?
Did I offend you somehow, or do you just need some time to yourself?
I just need some time to myself.
I have a lot to think about.
Which button do I press?
Press the button on the left of the elevator.
Thank you.
This one?
Yes, that's the right one.
So, it's kind of crowded today, huh?
No it's always crowded.
I want to watch a comedy.
How about Rush Hour?
I suppose we could watch that, though I'd prefer something else.
DO you have any SNL recorded?
Yes there's around 4 of them on the DVR.
Would you like to got to the movies tonight?
I would love to!
Do you know what movie you want to watch?
I don't care, you decide.
It'll be a surprise then!
For me, not you!
I have not seen your glasses.
Oh okay, I have misplaced them somewhere!
Did you look on your desk?
of course I did, you think I left them at the office?
It's possible, you can check tomorrow.
Yes, what do you need?
I need you to help me bring the groceries in please.
OK, where should I put them?
On the counter would be great.
Ok here you go.
Need help putting them away?
Molten Chocolate Lava cake with Raspberries    Oh my God, that sounds grand!
Yes, let's go get some!
I've been dying to try that new cafe.
Maybe it's on their menu?
I'll pull it up online and find out.
Me of course!
Mom, you totally don't count!
Why don't I count?
Because you are supposed to be my mom and not my friend.
is that so?
How is your fiancee?
My fiancee is doing fine now, thanks for asking.
Did he reobtain his driver licence?
What?
He never got it taken away in the first place.
My mistake!
I must have gotten him confused with someone else.
Do you know something I don't about him?
Is it close to time for dinner?
No, dinner will be in two hours.
What are we having?
We are having macaroni and cheese  Homemade, or the cheap box stuff?
The cheap box stuff, it's the best to me.
So you don't want to meet me for coffee in ten minutes?
Only if pastries are involved.
What did you think of the last episode of Outlander?
I thought it sucked, much like all the other episodes of Outlander.
Can we please talk about Game of Thrones instead?
No, not yet.
I haven't watched the newest episode.
You need to catch up then.
You're right.
I'm just puzzled by how you dislike Outlander but enjoy Game of Thrones.
Game of Thrones is just a lot better and more entertaining.
Can I have some chilled water, please?
It will have to be room temperature since I don't have any ice.
Oh that's not problem then.
OK, be right back.
Thanks.
Hope it's not too much trouble.
Of course not.
It's my pleasure.
How has your dad been?
He's doing well.
I saw him yesterday, he looked like he had seen a ghost.
He was meeting with his accountant yesterday.
That explains it.
Does he have the same accountant he used to?
I thought that guy went to jail for tax fraud.
Actually he's got a new accountant and they're going over all of his old taxes now.
That's probably why he looked so bad.
Around 11:30, I think.
Thanks very much.
Your welcome.
Does the bus stop at Tower Hill?
I'm not sure
Ill be back around noon     Make sure you pick up the mail before you come in.
Fine, if you insist that that's what I must do.
What's with the attitude?
I'm tired of the way you speak to me.
Make sure to pick up the mail, it's just rude.
You're always so dramatic!
That is the biggest exaggeration in the history of the planet!
Can you please hurry?
I will be as quick as I can	Okay.
We will be running a little bit late.
Dude, it's good to be late, it's called fashionable.
Late is still late, fashionable or no.
You get star like attention if you be late.
When do we need to leave?
No later then 9 or we will be late.
DO you think it would be faster to take a cab?
No way; but thanks for asking.
Then what the heck are we going to do, walk there?
No, my mom said I could use her car if I fill it with gas when I am done.
Did you like the match?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
What was your favorite part?
The one where the captain celebrated after his goal.
My favorite part was the snacks!
That sounds like you.
Can you make lunch now?
not right now.
What are you doing?
Answering silly questions on the computer.
Can't you go out and find a real job?
?How will I take care of the kids if I'm off working a job
Do you know of any good doctors?
Yes, I have a good one.
How much is her consultation fee?
Far more than you can afford, I'd bet.
Say's the man who sleeps in a cardboard box every night.
Says the man who doesn't have a doctor.
What do you like to do for fun?
Just for fun, I like to tell corny jokes.
You're joking, right?
No, why, does that seem weird?
I guess not, but where do you get fresh material?
Anywhere!
Walking around town, or watching videos online.
A year at best.
But my typing test is tomorrow!
Well that's not going to happen is it?
Why did you choose that?
Because it's my favorite color.
It doesn't really go well with the shoes, though.
Well, I have a bag to match with it.
ok, if you're sure you can make it work, go for it.
You know I can rock this look.
what is it like up there?
It gets cold during the winters, but it's not too bad.
I couldn't deal with the cold.
You just get used to it.
I guess so, but don't they get a lot of snow up there, too?
I hate snow.
Guess it's good you live elsewhere then.
I sure have!
Yes!
Congratulations to you!
Thanks!
I can't wait to start.
So where will you be working?
In McDonalds by the promenade.
Do you like eating at home or at a restaurant?
Home most days.
You must be a good cook then.
Yes, I've been cooking all my life and I really enjoy it.
What is your favorite dish to cook?
All of them!
No, I only have seasonal allergies.
Does that mean you'll be able to dogsit for us?
Sure I can dogsit for you.
Thanks a lot, I can never find a sitter.
It can be tough to find one out here in Alaska.
What happened, why you need my help?
My house Is on fire!
I'll be right over.
Hurry, it's going to burn down!
I already called 911!
Thank you so much!
Are you new here?
Relatively, yes.
I've been here about three weeks.
So you're new then.
I'm starting to feel more at home here though!
Do you need any recommendations?
Yes, any help would be appreciated!
Could I have something to drink?
Yes, what do you want?
Do you have any diet soda?
Yes I do have diet soda	Oh that will be good.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
There's still hope something might change, though.
Right?
I read something about that when it's in the early stages.
There are some life changes that may help, but there is no conclusive evidence that these changes will make improvements in your condition.
That's why my parents chose it.
So what about my name?
does that make me a usual person?
No, not at all.
Is it too late?
Not if it's before HIGH NOON.
I think it's at three p.m., so I guess that wouldn't work.
No, sounds like it wouldn't.
You are confusing me.
Oh!
sorry, yes it is too late for me.
Alright, cool!
Put me down for a haircut next week.
Sure, what day works best for you?
Wednesday works best for me.
Perfect.
I have three openings on Wednesday.
Do you prefer morning or afternoon?
Anyone up for a card game?
I'm in, how about a game of poker?
I was thinking more of Uno, but that's fine.
Okay, I'll play either one.
Ok, where are the cards?
In the hall closet on the middle shelf.
How old were you when you moved here?
I was 26	  That's young, do you like it here?
Yes, I love it.
What was your first impression of this city when you first moved?
It was so exciting!
What hours are you open?
Today we are open from 8 am to 9 pm.
What days are you open?
We are only open on Mondays.
Why are you only open on Mondays?
We don't like customers very much.
Not right now.
But I'm about to drop everything!
Oh, okay, sorry.
Thanks, I shouldn't have tried to carry so much.
Boy, you really stocked up at the grocery store.
What's on your mind?
Just thinking about the future!
Stay in the present, young padawan.
I try, but it is so hard.
Yes it is very hard.
That is why it takes lots of practice.
Thank you All Knowing One.
Did you tour a college this weekend?
No, I graduated from college 15 years ago.
Is that what I asked you?
That seems a little harsh.
I don't have any reason to tour one.
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
Let's start over.
I didn't go on any college tours this weekend, no.
Would you like to watch the game with me?
I would love to watch the game with you.
I love spending time with you.
The feeling is definitely mutual.
Should we grab something to eat before hand?
Yes, definitely!
Are you hungry for a pizza?
Have you tried that new coffee shop on the corner?
Yes their muffins are amazing!
Have you tried it?
I have they make amazing drinks.
We should go there together some time.
I'm down right now!
I know, but is the policy up to date?
Yes it is.
Ok, I just want to make sure that we are covered, just in case something happens when we are on vacation.
Sure, that's alright.
How was your day?
It was great.
So was mine, everything went well.
That's great to hear!
So, where do we go for dinner?
I feel like having sushi tonight, are you okay with that?
They loved it.
Oh my God, that makes me so happy to hear that!
Me too, I'm so relieved.
Me too, because I like it	   What, in particular, is your favorite part?
Where is the dog?
Last time I saw him he was in the kitchen.
Make sure he doesn't have mud on his feet.
Why would he have mud on his feet?
He might have been outside playing in the mud.
Got it, will check.
How long until the cake is done baking?
About five more minutes.
You need to be patient!
But it smells so good!
It will taste even better.
I can hardly wait!
Why not go to the store and get some milk while you are waiting?
Can you get me some nail clippers?
Yes I can  I really need to clip these nails.
I hate when mine are out of control.
Do you need new nail clippers too?
Mine still work fine.
Do you like the food?
No, I didn't like that food that was so spicy.
Would you have liked it if it were less spicy?
Maybe.
I did like the flavors, I just did not like the spice.
What did you like the best?
The wedge salad was great.
Do you need lunch money?
Yes, please.
Ten bucks should cover it.
There you go!
Please, if there is any change left, give it back to me.
Thank you!
I'll get it back to you right away.
Lunch was a lot cheaper when I was younger	Yeah, you're old.
I know.
Haha!
What is the weather supposed to be?
Rainy and cold but no snow  That's good to hear, I don't have a snow shovel.
You should head out and pick one up before the first storm!
I suppose, but I'm too lazy to go right now.
Haha!
You'll regret it!
But I told you I became a vegan!
Oh sorry, I keep forgetting.
Well, I think they sell salads too.
You're so insensitive.
Sorry.
Lets just go have a nice salad.
Do you want to go running today?
I hurt my knee yesterday.
I'm sorry to here that.
I guess I'll have to go it alone.
I hope your knee get's better!
Yeah, I hope so too.
I'm going to see a doctor about it today.
Well, good luck with that.
Thanks so much!
We had a minor disagreement.
What was the disagreement about?
She didn't like my dinner suggestion.
What did you suggest?
Curry and pita bread.
How did you do that?
With lots and lots of practice.
How long have you been playing?
For a little over five years.
Who is your teacher?
It looks like it would be fun to learn.
It is a lot of fun.
Was your visit a good one?
No, my visit went horribly, it rained the entire time.
Oh man, that stinks.
Yes, it was very disappointing.
Did you at least manage to do what you had planned?
No!
I ended up sitting in my room all day waiting it out, but it never happened.
Oh well!
Which herbs did you plant?
I planted basil, cilantro, sage, and thyme.
Oh, how is it growing?
Its growing fine.
I sure can.
Awesome!
Thanks so much!
Tell me when to stop.
One can never have too much salt and pepper on one's potatoes.
Mmmm, and butter.
Salt, pepper and buttery potatoes are the bomb!
I know, let's hope it's not too hot though.
Are they getting married here, or going somewhere?
They are doing a wedding in the park, which will be lovely, but warm.
What have you done lately?
Just work and take care of the kids.
How old are your kids now?
They're eleven and fourteen.
What are their names?
John and Marry
Yes, come here and sit down.
Ok, thank you.
You are welcome.
What is your password?
I can't get logged in.
Wait, let me type that for you.
Cereal would be good.
Do you have any?
I do have cereal,what kind would you like?
Do you have Lucky Charms?
No sorry, I don't have Lucky Charms because I'm not 11 years old.
You are 35 Mike, you need to start acting like it.
Do you think we will be able to go to the play tonight?
Yes, if daddy gives us permission.
I hope he does.
I hope so to if not we can ask mommy	 Mommy always says yes.
Well, one of them will need to bring us, so I hope at least one says yes.
Have you read the news today?
No I missed today's paper.
There was a big article about a new political scandal.
what did it say?
Why don't you read it for yourself?
I'm too lazy today!
I'm heading to the fourth floor, want to catch the elevator together?
Certainly, but I want to go to the second floor.
That's not a problem.
Ok, there's the elevator  Can you push the button for the 2nd floor please?
Yeah, no prob.
I didn't see you for ages, how are you?
Great thanks, I was just on vacation backpacking through Afghanistan!
Wow, did you take any pictures?
Yes, I have about 500.
Would you like to see them?
I can't right now.
Can you come over this weekend and show them to me then?
Heck yea!
I will even throw some food on the bbq and we can make a day of it!
What time do we need to arrive by?
We need to arrive by 3 pm Then that means we need to leave here by 2pm.
Are you driving or am I?
You should drive this time.
ok I will drive
Today is the 20th of July.
Are you sure it's not the 21st?
I just looked at the date on my phone.
Oh, ok. My days are starting to run together; can't keep up with what day it actually is.
I get like that too sometimes.
He said you never called him and he was wondering why not.
I lost his number.
Did you lose it on purpose?
No, of course not!
I lost it when I was sorting thru the mail.
Do you remember that time we saved that bird in the park?
I do.
It was great.
Sometimes I wonder if the bird remembers us.
Remember us?
I doubt it, but I guess you never know.
Maybe we could find an ornithologist and ask him how well birds remember people.
Seems like a lot of work though.
Did you watch the game last night?
no had to work late	   You really missed a great game.
Don't spoil it!
I have it on my DVR.
So you really don't want to talk about the game?
No.
Not until I watch it first.
Do you like turtles?
No, because one bit me once.
What did you do to make a turtle bite you?
Well I was putting my finger in front of it's mouth to check it wouldn't bite me.
But then it did, so now I hate turtles and am still oblivious to my own stupidity.
Dude, you'd better stay away from all animals I think.
I try but they keep following me home.
I don't know what to do!
Thanks.
I've been looking for it all day.
Want me to go get it and hand it to you right now?
That would be great.
Could you also place it on my head for me?
I guess so, here you go.
I would rather wear something black   Fine, then find something yourself.
Could you help me decide between these two black items?
I like the one on the left more.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I have tickets to the ball game and Sam and I are meeting for early dinner then heading over.
WHere were you?
We all piled into the truck and headed down to the lake for a barbecue.
Sounds like fun, I should do that with my family next time	 Yeah, it was a good time.
What did she say?
Not all that much, honestly.
She seemed pretty upset.
I bet, it's a pretty bad situation.
I hope she can take some time off from work.
They told her she can have all of the time she needs.
That's good of them, she really needs it.
He will probably be well soon.
What's wrong with him?
He has strep throat and a double ear infection.
Out to eat, want to join?
Can you give me a recipe?
Depends on what you want to cook.
The special one you have for chicken and dumplings.
Oh, I don't know.
That's actually my mom's secret recipe.
Please?
It is my sweet-heart's favorite.
I promise not to publish it on the 'net.
That's what you said about my honeymoon photos.
Do you think I have what it takes to be a model?
No, because you're too short.
There must a need to model for short people.
I don't know.
Do short people buy clothes?
Yes short people buy clothes, but no one wants to see short people on the runway!
That isn't true, celebrities make appearances on the runway all the time and they often much shorter than the average model.
It starts in 30 minutes.
Who are you rooting for?
The home team.
That is who I am rooting for also.
Come over and watch it with me.
Are we done yet?
it depends on what you consider to be done Way to be snarky about it, jerk.
Well it's a team project, so we both decide when it's done.
Well, I think it's done.
What do you think still needs to be done?
i think we need one finishing touches.
Sorry to hear that, can you tell me what happened?
Not right now.
Why not?
I thought we were close.
Not as close as you think.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
How else I'm I supposed to feel, we just met yesterday.
Is there any ice cream in the freezer?
No, but there are some ice lollies.
OK, can you please grab me one?
No, you get up and do it your self.
Well that's the last time I grab you something from the store, mate.
I won't pay the rent this month, bloke.
Yes, a glass of water please.
Would you like ice with your water?
No, I can't stand water with ice in it.
Why do you dislike ice in your water?
It's too cold and it hurts my teeth.
Would you like to have lunch with me?
I'd be delighted to have lunch with you.
Do you have any preferences?
There's a new restaurant over in Oakdale that I've been wanting to try out.
Fun!
What kind of restaurant is it?
It's Thai Food.
Where are you going?
To the zoo and a movie Awesome!
Can we come too?
Sure, if you hurry.
We're leaving in 30 minutes.
Cool, thanks.
This should be fun!
Don't you want to know which movie we are seeing?
What breed of dog is that?
She is a mix breed, schnauzer and poodle.
Mixed breed dogs are the best kind.
I just love all dogs.
Oh, yeah that's cool.
Where did you get her from?
Go up those stairs, to the left.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
You as well.
Before I go do I need a key or anything?
No, it's unlocked.
Can we go to the store later tonight?
Yes, around what time?
Is 11 pm fine for you?
Yes, that's perfect.
Cool, I'll call you when I leave the house.
my phone is broken remember?
yeah no problem I'll be there soon	Great, I'll be waiting anxiously.
And I will be moving hurriedly.
What is your estimated time of arrival?
I will be there in 15 minutes, estimatedly.
Does it contain Soya?
It isn't listed on the ingredients so I would have to say no.
Thank you for checking.
You're very welcome, I hope I'm right.
What do you mean you hope?
I heard that food companies sort of disguise ingredients in food?
Why don't we go out for a meal later?
Alright, where should we go?
How about Panera?
Sounds like a plan, man.
Do you know if they have any new salads?
Was there a spicy chicken salad on the menu?
Something with a little kick.
Have you ever visited Spain?
No, but I'd love to see the bull run.
How about you?
The bull run sounds dangerous and inhumane.
I guess, but there's lots more to see and do.
We could go throw tomatoes at each other.
That sounds gross and messy.
I despise dogs, but I love peanut butter.
Are you more of a cat person?
I love cats, and also peanut butter.
But not together.
Why do you like peanut butter so much?
Who doesn't love peanut butter?
Where did you buy your house?
I got it from an old lady who lived here before.
How long have you lived in it?
I have lived here for 10 years.
I heard your house is haunted.
That's not true at all.
Who knows?
Next weekend maybe?
Maybe?
Why, what's going to happen to me?
What do you know?
Nothing.
You're being paranoid.
I am not being paranoid.
Yes, you are one hundred percent being paranoid!
Oh, I don't want to go if there are annoying kids there, either.
Do you know if there is an adults only pool here?
No clue, but we should ask.
Do you want me to call and ask?
How long have you worked here?
I started last January.
Have you learned a lot?
Yeah sure.
In five months I've learned how to put condiments on buns.
Huge accomplishment.
if you hate it so much why have you been here five months?
Ever heard of rent?
What is his name?
His name is Ken.
Where did you meet him?
We went to college together.
And you just happened to run into him?
We were standing in the same line at Starbucks.
Sure, you have to double-click on the icon.
Which icon do I click on?
You click the small yellow icon on the bottom right of your screen.
Thanks, now I see it.
Is it working now for you?
What breed is she?
She Is a labrador retirever.
Is she obedient?
When she wants something, yes.
What do you feed her?
Oh the usual grain free diet
Yes, It should.
If it doesn't I am sure we can tow it behind the car.
Do you really think that towing it will be safe?
I'm not sure if it's safe but it's the only way we're getting this thing home	I don't think that's a good idea though.
They are acting horrible.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, they need to be punished.
That sounds a bit harsh.
Try checking what they want first.
Sure, because I haven't already fed them, taken them to the park, turned on their favorite movie and offered them crayons, playdoh and silly string.
Where was the last place you looked for it?
I looked in my room.
If you kept it tidier, maybe you'd find it.
Hahahah you're so funny.
Since it's lost forever in your room of doom lets go get another one.
But I've had this one for ages!
It's my favourite.
How long will they be mowing?
A couple of hours, I guess.
Are they going to edge also?
That's not in the agreement but if I ask him nicely I'm sure he will do it.
Sure where would you like to go?
I'd like some Thai food.Then how about some ice cream?
Wow seems like a great idea.
Do you have headphones I could use?
Yes, I have a spare set.
Nevermind I found mine.
Where did you find them?
They were underneath the couch.
Hey, did you happen to feel a flip flop while you were down there?
Mine left shoe has been missing for over a week.
No, I can't seem to get it, either.
I think we need a new can opener.
I will pick one up.
All right then.
Do you need money to buy a new one?
How did you do?
I believe I did pretty well.
Shew!
You probably did a lot better than myself.
Oh come on, I'm sure you did great.
Nope, I'm a loser, baby.
Not in my eyes.
Why did she leave early yesterday?
The vet called about her dog.
I hope everything is alright with her pet	she just needs to pick it up.
Oh, that's relieving.
Trust me.
If anything was wrong with her dog you would have known today.
Speaking of overboard, have you tried that sailing trip yet?
Can I have some orange juice, please?
Certainly, let me get you a glass.
Can I have some without pulp, please?
I'm sorry, I only have extra pulp.
Can we run it through the strainer?
Sure!
I'll be back in 2 minutes.
Probably sometime in the afternoon.
Did you find her yet?
No, of course I haven't.
That's why I'm putting up Cat Missing signs!
Well, where did you look already?
Around the block.
Yes, they're listed on the wall.
I was thinking more extraordinary specials.
Would you like me to see what the chef could whip up?
Maybe a Mediterranean seafood pasta?
Are mussels, shrimp and calamari all right?
WHat should we drink today?
It's really hot outside.
Let's get some lemonade.
Where do you want to get it from?
Let's get it from the house a street over, they have a stand out right now.

I like to patronize local businesses.

How about Big Foot Java?
The people there are really nice.
I don't really go to a coffee place for the people.
Can you check it?
yes, there is a coat check up front  Is the coat check free?
No, of course it's not.
What kind of club do you think we are at?
One where the coat check isn't free, evidently.
This is a business I'm running, not a charity.
Yes, that is the next available appointment.
I have confirmed your appointment for June 8th at 1:50pm.
Excuse me, do you remember me?
I am so sorry I do not remember you.
We Met at Jans party.
There were so many people there though.
I was the guy who put the lamp shade on his head.
Oh, yes.
The one everyone disliked.
I don't think so, I think they are just taking a break.
I guess that's better than getting divorced.
They should try and work it out.
I agree.
They should try to work it out.
Well I hope they do work it out.
Me too.
It would be too bad if they have to get a divorce.

Yes.
Is noon a good time for you?
Where did the time go?
I feel we wasted an entire day	What did we actually do all day?
Sat around and watched Netflix.
Well, Netflix and chill isn't a complete waste of time.
Still we should put in at least a couple hours into that paper.
And waste a perfectly good evening?
Let's go for a walk, grab dairy queen and then burn off the calories on the walk back.
Where is the remote control?
It's on the table.
Can you get it for me please?
Sure, no problem!
Here it is.
Thanks, I can't wait to watch the new episode     Have you seen this show from the beginning of the season?
Why are you acting like that?
I don't know what you think is different.
You have been very short today.
Sorry we can't all be six feet tall.
I'll come back when you're in a better mood, short fry.
Bring me ketchup when you do.
Where should we go?
How about Chinese?
Sure!
The new place down the street?
Yeah, I haven't tried them yet.
How did you come?
Your car or public transport?
We took the bus to get over here.

I would love to go to the park.
Yes, do you need quarters, nickles, dimes, or pennies?
Four quarters please.
Too bad I only have pennies.
In that case, I'll just keep my dollar.
Have a good day, sir.
No because it's in your hand	   That's not my phone, that's my mothers cell phone.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had the same one.
Have you tried calling it yet?
No, I'll try it now.
No you may not.
How come I cannot have something to eat?
Because I don't have anything prepared.
Don't you have anything to snack on?
Fine, yes.
But you have to go get it yourself.
I am doing well today, how about you?
I've been better.
What is wrong?
My dog died.
I am sorry about that.
Thanks.
It was unexpected.

I don't think he was.
I didn't get to see much because of all of the commotion going on and people moving out of the way.
Who let the dog out?
Your nephew, of course.
Will you help me catch the dog before he eats the neighbor's trash again?
I'll do my best.
Good, that dog loves to eat trash and my neighbor gets really mad     Maybe if you fed him well, he wouldn't be looking for food in other people's trash.
Have you seen the new film?
Yeah, I saw it on opening weekend.
It was so-so.
It had really good reviews though, I think I'll see it anyway.
Go ahead if you want to.

You told me you weren't seeing Steven anymore!

You came early, did you get off work early?
Yeah, we were pretty slow so they sent me home   Is work usually this slow?
No, this is unusual.
Well, I hope you get to work a full day tomorrow.
Not me.
I'm salaried, so I'm hoping I get sent home again tomorrow.
How long until I can get up?
Two more hours.
Two more hours?
I'll be so bored!
You have to rest your legs from all the walking yesterday.
Did you watch the game last night?

Why are you taking so long?
Because I want to.
Why do you want to take so long?
Because I can do whatever I want to.
Yes your highness lord of everything.
That's the spirit loyal subject.
I do when I have time.
Your art is good, you should try and set aside time for it.
I should, but I've been really busy with work lately.

I like your stuff a lot.
Thanks Grandma, that is sweet of you.
How's Grandpa doing?

I have that problem when my allergies bother me.
Where should I start?
At the beginning please?
Alright, I'll talk slower this time.
What do you think of it here?
It's nice, a little too quiet though.
We can turn up the music, if you'd like.
It isn't really the lack of noise, it's the lack of activity.

I love good peaches when you can get them.

I didn't, I need to step out for lunch today.
Awesome!

Sure if you want to go to the grocery store down the street that has the salad bar.

LeBron looked sluggish though.
I agree.

McDonalds and Applebees    Let's go to Applebee's!

I don't like wings, they are messy.
I usually use Google.
I don't like Google.
Is there a better one?
Have you tried a specialized search engine?
I like the one at allrecipes.
I have never used that but I will give it a shot.
If you do use that site search for the Tuna Souvlaki Pasta.
Also they have a bunch of Ramadan recipes too!
What did you get mom?
A new bathrobe.
Did she say she wanted one?
I bought her a gift certificate for the Spa because she was saying last week she wanted to go there.
That's nice too.
But I'm quite sure mom will like my gift better.
Because it's from her favourite child.
I'm sure you mean my gift, because I'm her favorite child.
She will like both of our gifts.

Yes I lived in Bordeaux for 13 years.
Where did you go to college?

I had so many coffee dates you wouldn't believe it!
Where is the bathroom?
Look out for the sign, it's just up ahead.

I'll meet you right here as soon as I get out of there.
OK, what are we getting from here?
I was hoping we could grab some lunch.
What's on sale at the bakery this week?
Sir, this is a hotel, and I've told you several times already today that such a sentence is not a code for any special services at the hotel.
Please stop.
Listen; my friend told me this was a place to get hash brownies so cough up the goods!
Leave or I will call the police.
But I AM the police!
Good then you're already here!
Are you free tonight?
No, I have a date with my couch.

How did Sam get such good grades?
He studied constantly and worked with several tutors.
How much did the tutors cost?
I think like $50 a session.
Not a bad return on investment I'd say!
Yes, I am quite satisfied with his results.
Which shampoo do you use?
I use this stuff I found at the dollar store.
It is only a dollar and has color protection for my hair!
Wow!
I wouldn't think that coming from the Dollar Store!
I was surprised, too.
You are braver than I am.
I would be afraid it would fry my hair.
Well, it did make some of my hair fall out, but the color protection is still great.
Sometime in July.
Well, good luck.
Thanks!
You're so kind.
Do you think you will pass?
I've been studying up a storm so I hope I pass.
I'm good.
How are you?
Awesome,thank you so much    Well, have a nice day.
You, too.
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you too.
Tell your sister I said hi.
When will the nurse come to see me?
She is on her way and will be here within the next 15 minutes.
Ok thank you.
No problem.
Are you comfortable?
Yeah, I am pretty comfortable.
Do you need a refill on your water?
How did that happen?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean you're not sure?
I mean that I could give an answer, but I'd have a pretty good chance of being wrong.
You must have been super drunk.
We may have been drunk, and I may have forgotten, but I was able to convince you not to drive that night.
What did you think I said?
For a second there, it sounded like Oh No.
Oh, nope, I was just saying hi!
Where do you think you are going?
I really want to go to the mall, can I?
I guess you can.
Ask first next time.
Okay, I'm sorry.
While you're there can you buy me some socks?
What color would you like?
Do you know if it is raining yet?
I don't know, I haven't looked outside.
Does your phone not have the weather?
I never feel 100% sure unless I can see it for myself.
I know what you mean; weather apps are so often inaccurate!
We both have serious problems if we can't trust that it's raining until we actually feel it touching our bodies.
Perhaps we should seek psychiatric assistance for our trust issues.
Did you take your pills?
No, I forgot to take my pills     Aren't they for forgetfullness?
Very funny.
No, of course they don't make pills for that.
What a shame, you really could use some of those!
haha, I believe they should indeed.
When will you come back?
Right after I drop the kids off at hockey practice, why?
Great, can you please pick up some milk at the store on your way back?
Sure, do I need to pick up anything else while I'm there?
Get me a box of donuts; I need to put on some weight.
No donuts, Dear; We are starting our diet today.
In the closet.
Has it been dry cleaned?
Yes, last week.
The cleaner even sewed on the loose button.
Thank you so much honey!
I love that coat and have missed not wearing it.
I am taking you out for dinner tonight as a thank you.
Thank you Honey!
that is so sweet of you!
Is your mom coming to visit tomorrow?
Yes, after lunch.
Do you mind if I stop by?
I would love to see her.
Absolutely , she would love to see you also!
How is she doing?
She is doing well, she had surgery last week so she has been resting.
Has anyone else arrived?
Yes a few people are already in the room.
Good; I hate being the first to arrive.
Don't forget to greet everyone, those are very important clients.
What have you bought, today?
Groceries and dog food	 Good.
We need more dog food.
Did we need groceries too?
Yes!
It's not just the dog who needs to eat!
Yes, we need to eat too!
How's your wife doing?
She's better now that she's had the procedure done.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Give her my best, would you?
Of course, she'll be happy to hear I saw you today.
I know!
I have been thinking a lot about you guys lately.
You're very thoughtful.
What are your summer vacation plans?
I don't have any plans yet.
You should come to the beach with us!
I am not sure.
I think I may just get a part time job this summer.
Tired of eating ramen noodles.
You could work for a couple of months and then take a week off.
You should learn to love more and judge a little less.
I'm not feeling well.
Why, what's wrong with you?
I have a really bad headache.
Maybe you should step away from your computer and phone for a bit.
You literally pay me to be at my computer and phone all day.
Are you offering me a paid vacation?
Not any time soon!
Of course you are!
No, I'm not.
Good, then you can take off with me to Bermuda.
Don't I wish?
Where did you buy your wallet?
I found it in the street.
Did you try to return it?
It did not have anything in it so I don't know where I would return it.
It was probably stolen and tossed after the money and credit cards were removed.
I think I will turn it in to the police.
I will give it to you.
thank you very much   You're quite welcome  Can you pass me the thing next to it too?
I can't remember what you call these things!
Sure not a problem, would you also like the others next to it?
I am asking because you look really pale and tired.
I had trouble sleeping last night but the coffee is starting to kick in.
That reminds me, I need a cup myself.
How could you ever forget your coffee?
If you need me to.
What should I tell him?
Tell him I will be late  Fine, though you could really do that yourself.
I'm making the pie filling and I don't want to get jam all over the phone.
Oh, no problem.
I'll call him.
No, more like a total loss.
Did anyone get hurt?
No, the other driver was totally drunk but somehow came out without a scratch.
Is there anything on TV tonight?
I don't know.
Look it up on your phone.
Alright, just give me one second.
One.
Time's up!
You knew what I meant smartie pants!
I know, I know you hate how literal I am.
Sounds good.
Who shall we invite?
How about Jack and Diane?
Is it a bad thing that I don't receive my medication in time?
Yes.
Medication should be taken in a timely manner.
Who can I complain to?
You should call the head nurse.
What is the head nurse's name?
I don't know but I bet if you press that red button someone will show up
Can you pick me up?
Yes, whenever you are ready.
I'm ready right now, come right now!
Ok I'm on my way  Call me when you get here.
Okay, sure thing.
Is it raining outside?
No, but it might rain later today.
Will it get colder, too?
I'm not positive, but a taking a sweater with you might be smart.
I will.
Thanks for the warning!
You're welcome, have a good time.
How long has he been there?
For about 2 weeks.
What has he been doing all this time?
I am not at liberty to say what has been going on in his room, but you are more than welcome to go see him.
Well that's a little harsh, you don't know that!
No but I'll bet my next paycheck on it.
Well I will take that bet.
Be prepared to lose.
She'll be back on Monday.
It's only a short business trip this time.
I don't know what I'll do with myself until she gets back.
We could hang out together on Saturday.
at the back on the left Can I bring all of these clothes in with me?
Only if you promise not to steal anything.
What is that supposed to mean?
You know what; never mind!
Sorry, just trying to be funny.
It's sunny outside.
I think I will do some gardening today.
That sounds like fun!
I love watching my flowers bloom.
Mind If I help?
I love blooming flowers more than life itself.
Can you open the door for me?
Yes, sure I can.
Thank you very much, son.
You are very welcome father.
Now go and clean that trash heap you call your room.
But I don't even live here anymore
Who is this and where do you want me to pick you up?
It's Bill, and I need you to pick me up at the store.
I will be right there, don't go anywhere.
Ok I'm out front by the kids electric train.
Ok.
I will be there in about 10 minutes.
Please hurry, this train is driving me nuts.
Can you turn up the volume on the television?
Sure, as soon as I find the remote.
Can't we just go up to the television to turn it up?
yeah if I wanted to	You may be the laziest person I know.
Then again, it may be someone else.
Could you come over?
I can come later today.
Ok, I'll be waiting.
Want me to pick up anything?
Yes, a box of KFC would be great.
okay will bring.
Did you remember to take your library books back on Tuesday?
Yes, stop nagging me!
Don't talk to me like that , I was trying to help	       It's not helping if I don't want you to do it.
Well I'm your mother so I will nag you if I think you need it.
The only thing that keeps me from running away, is dinner!
Do you like Starbucks?
Yes but they're expensive.
But their coffee is sure good.
There really is no comparison.
Has the doctor arrived?
No, not yet.
But we have waited as the first in line for two hours!
I'm sorry, he's really busy.
This is a medical urgency!
I will go find out what's the hold up.
give me a moment please.
What rides did you ride while at the park?
I went on a few roller coasters.
Do they have the nasty one with all the loops?
What movies are in your top 5 of all time?
Police Academy, Police Academy II, Police Academy:Mission To Moscow, Baby Geniuses and Metropolis.
I see you like the deep intellectual stuff.
Nice  Yeah, that's why we aren't friends.
Then why are you standing here talking to me?
I'm conducting interviews with people who enjoy trivial movies.
Are you kidding me?
Yes, I was.
Well that was inappropriate.
I'm sorry, I won't do that again.
Thank you.
Let's talk about something else now.
What do you want to talk about?
What time tomorrow?
Probably seven o'clock.
I'm not sure, of course, as I can't see into the future.
Well if it's done by seven we can get dinner afterwards.
I'd like that.
Where would you like to go?
Did she agree to go with you to the party?
No she did not.
Well, just mark her off the list for future adventures.
Doesn't that sound kind of harsh?
Yeah maybe a little, but it is better to be safe than sorry where the heart is concerned.
I don't know dude, you've got to give people second chances.
How was the gym?
My workout today was really hard.
Well it will get easier the more you work out I think it's easier to just quit.
It is but not as rewarding.
True, maybe I'll keep on for a while yet.
When will you call me?
I'll give you a call Friday when I'm off work, sometime after 5pm, and we can make arrangements.
Change that to 6pm, 5 is dinner time.
How about you call me when you are done with dinner?
That sounds like a plan.
I'll check movie times at the new cineplex.
Any preference?
I've got time.
Whatever version you want to tell is fine.

I enjoy treasure hunting.
Where do you go treasure hunting?

If I eat dessert, my stomach will explode.
Okay, no dessert for you then.
I could go for a coffee though.
What about sausage and salami?
screw it we will get everything
Sure, when do you want me to pick you up?
An hour maybe    Okay, I'll see you around 6:00 then!
Great, I can't wait to see you!
Be ready, you usually take forever!
I'll set my clocks ahead a few minutes so I'm ready on time.

She likes everything about Patrick.
What do you think of Patrick?
I think he is a spoiled brat to be honest.
Do you enjoy cold weather?
Yes it was a nice break from the heat.
Where are you from?
Arizona.
The heat can be unbearable there sometimes.
So I have heard.
Have you ever thought of moving someplace a little cooler?
From time to time, but I get over it.
Can I watch TV?
After you finish your homework.
I already finished.
Then go ahead, son!
Thanks!
My favorite cartoon is on.
You are welcome!
Yes, they are hard but it means we won't have to take that statistics course.
Sounds good, you do the work and give me the answers.
How about no!
Let's share the work, it'll be quicker that way.
Should I pick you up?
No I'll walk Thank you though.
I might need a ride back home if that is ok.		  Sure I'll be leaving at 11pm.
Okay I will text you if I need a ride home.
Uh oh, let me make sure I have my cell.
I always forget it.
Where is the car?
In the parking lot.
Is the tank full or I will have to go to the gas station?
You'll have to stop at the gas station    where is the nearest gas station then?
Just a mile after you exit the parking lot.
Well here, take my umbrella just in case.
Will Eva help me with my studies?
Yes, she is an excellent tutor.
Thank god!
I was looking for someone who could teach me, my exams are near.
Yeah, you'll like her.
She's very smart.
I hope not too smart, where she can't get on my level on understanding.
Oh no, she is the best.
help me pass my finals.
I would like to leave at noon.
OK, make sure you have your things ready.

Do you have a snack preference?
I'd like to get something we all like.
Do you carry plastic garbage bags at this store?
No, but we do sell reusable bags if you'd like to purchase one.
Are they reusable shopping bags or reusable garbage bags?
Reusable shopping bags that can be used for garbage bags	  Who the heck would do that with those bags?
No thanks	I guess you'll just carry around all your garbage then.
What did you have for breakfast today?
I ate cold pizza.
I think cold pizza is disgusting.
I think your face is disgusting, but I was able to use good manners and keep that opinion to myself all this time.
Wow, that escalated quickly.
Geez.
As usual between us!
Can I have a cookie?
No, honey, you have to have dinner first.

Dinner will be ready in about 30 minutes.
It won't be long.

Put it in your phone so you don't lose it.
Actually, can you send me a text instead?

Take your time!
Okay, I'll do it in a few minutes.
Well, you can certainly try.
This better not happen again, though.
I'm serious.
I'm so sorry!
What do you need me to do?
I need to feel like I can trust you.
What can I do to make you trust me again?
I don't know, but it's going to take time.
Trust doesn't just magically appear when you want it to.
Is it still raining?
Yes, it's a monsoon!
I can not make it tonight   Ok. Hopefully ma see ya soon!
Yes, a little rain storm won't stop me	       But a monsoon will?

You never do anything for me.
I do things for you all the time!
Give me an example.
Who pays for the lights to stay on?
Who's car do you take to work everyday?
Those are two examples for you.
Could you please help me pick out a cell phone provider?
I think sprint is best  Sprint took me to court over a unpaid $16 bill.
That's ridiculous.
What about Verizon?
Sure, what are their rates?
I have no idea, I'm with Sprint.
Who did you vote for?
I forgot to vote.
How on Earth could you forget to vote?
Because I have a lot on my mind.
You only vote once!
What could be more important?
Anything is more important than voting.
What does that weirdo want?
Probably to complain about the noise again  You realize he can hear you through the door, right?
Pretty sure he heard you call him a weirdo too.
I don't know where he went, have you tried calling him?
I did but it went straight to voicemail.
Did you leave a message?
I did, but who knows if he will check it.
I know his usual hangouts, I'm going to get in the car and go find his butt.
He knows I will drag his butt out of a party if he is at a party.
You are certainly a very dedicated teacher, Mary Kay.
What time is it?
It is a quarter after 10.
Oh!
I really need to get home, then!
Have a safe drive!
I will thanks.
its ok dude
Will I be able to sit for the exams?
Yes, we have desks for you to sit In.
Great, I'd look silly sitting on the floor.
Why did you think you would have to sit on the floor?
Well it is a yoga exam.
I'm surprised they are supplying desks.
Well I am suprised I am still shouting over this, but here I am, shouty mcshoutface again!
How was the show?
Terrible.
The worst show I've ever been to.
Oh my gosh, what are you going to tell her?
I'm not going to tell her, I will lie.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
No.
I guess you are right.
I should just be honest.
Have you ever tried chocolate covered ants?
I would never eat that.
Have you tried them?
What part of never do you not get?
Well, yeah, I guess that makes sense.
What makes you ask that anyway?
Do you have some?
Could you recommend a good book to me?
Yes, you should read Infinite Jest.
I said a GOOD book.
It's a pretty funny book.
We must have totally different taste in reading material.
To each his own.

If you would like one yes	I'm so thirsty I could drink a whole ocean.
You shouldn't.
It's saltwater.
Well, how about the great lakes?
yes you can
So what do you have planned for dinner?
I'm sort of hoping to go out.
Where are you planning on going?
To a Mexican restaurant.
Mexican food is my favorite, can I come along?
I guess.
I don't think anyone would mind.
Do you prefer cars or bikes?
I prefer cars so that I can bring people along with me.
I feel the same way.
Do you want to go on a road trip next weekend?
Sure, shall we hit up Vegas again?
No, I'd rather head into Santa Monica.
What happened at the party?
People danced and had a good time.
What time did the party end?
About midnight or so.
I assumed it would go later, that's why I didn't go.
No, it wasn't a late night party at all.
Pretty good so far.
That's good.
It's always nice to have a good start to a day.
What did you do?
So far have just gotten coffee.
Any big plans for the rest of the day?
Wow, nice shoes!
Where did you get those?
Thanks!
I got them online at Amazon.com.
Were they expensive?
Well, kind of.
But they were exactly what I've been looking for, so it's worth it.
Maybe I will get some new shoes too, I need some.
If you need shoes, be sure to check Amazon.
What happened to make you feel that way?
She broke up with me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What should I have done differently?
I'm sorry, man.
I just don't know.
Why did she have to leave me?
I could have changed.
What will you do tommorow?
I have class at 9 and then am free for the rest of the day.
Can you come to the mall with me?
Sure.
I need to buy some new socks.
Great.
We can grab some lunch while we are there.
Sounds good.
Want to head to Chipotle for lunch?
No not yet.
Hmm, I may need to speak with your supervisor then.
Please speak to him soon.
I will let you know what I find out.
I really appreciate that.
Do you have any Aleeve?
Let me check.
Thanks, I have a terrible headache.
I sympathize since I suffer with migraines.
That sounds horrible, how often do you get them?
Every few weeks.
I have medicine, but it's at home.
Light and sweet please		I only have skim light and chemical sweet.
Is that okay?
That will work if that's all you have.
okay coming right up.
Where are my red socks, do you know?
In the dryer.

I did, sorry.
It's ok.

yes you will
What date is today?
It's may 25th.
What day of the week is it?
Today is Wednesday.
Jeez, I'm really kind of lost nowadays.
Really?
What's been going on?
Where should we go tonight?
Dinner and a movie sounds good.
Sure, but please not the Olive Garden again for dinner.
How about Hamburgers somewhere?
I don' know about hamburgers, how about pizza?
Pizza sounds good, but I want to have a burger next time we go out.
Did you let the dog out?
Yes but he is back in now.
Could you make sure he's dry?
Okay, let me check.
Make sure he doesn't have dirt on his paws either.
He is dry and has no dirt on his paws.
This room stinks, can you open the windows?
Yes, I'll do that now.
Thanks.
It already smells better in here.
Would you like me to light the candle, too?
If you wouldn't mind.
What smell would you prefer?
Is the Air conditioner on?
Yes.
Is it still warm in here?
Yes, I'm still sweating due to the heat.
I think the air conditioner is not working well.
So call someone to fix it.
Why do I always have to call?
You know how to use a phone, too.
You don't always have to call.
But I'm working now and you have some free time.
So call, please.
Can you put the baseball game on the TV?
No, I do not like baseball, but you can turn it on in the family room.
You can come and watch it with me and see if you change your mind?
No, thanks maybe another time.
What is it you don't like about it?
It's boring.
It's quiet, there is no real point to it.
I just don't get the fascination with baseball.
How are you doing?
Very well, thank you.
Do you have any big plans for the weekend?
My plans for the weekend are so big, that they will cover next weekend as well.
Oh, it's one of those weekends.
Yes it is indeed!
How is your mom?
She's doing great.
Good to hear.
How are your parents doing?
Good.
Just on their way to Florida for the winter.
I would love to spend the winters in Florida.
Who am I kidding, I would love to spend all seasons in Florida.
How are your allergies doing now that spring is here?
I don't have spring allergies.
I must be thinking of someone else.
You got that right.
You are the person who gets migraines then?
Yes, you're giving me one right now.
They are but we still have more work than time.
Alright, what's next?
I'm not sure; I ate the instructions this morning for breakfast.
We can search online for a copy.
How much is it?
Well, because we're friends, I'll only charge you $50.
That's still not good enough.
What would you think is more reasonable?
I think $40 should be more than enough for that.
I spent $60 for it new and never used it so I need to charge $50
Do you have thread?
Yes, I have sewing thread.
What color do you need?
Do you have any purple?
I might have purple.
Let me look.
If you don't have purple I think black would work as well.
I have purple and black as well
How is your day?
Just fantastic.
How's yours     It's going well, actually.
My brother was just released from jail today.
Oh great!
I want to see him!
Ok, but you have to go to his house, he's has an ankle monitor so is not allowed over 200 feet from his house.
That's probably a good thing.
How are your children?
They are well, thank you.
How are they in school?
They are doing rather well.
How is your husband?
He's doing well, too!
Things are going pretty great for us.
How about you?
Excuse me, do you know where I can find this item?
It is on the next aisle.
The next aisle to the right, or to the left?
The aisle to the right.
Okay, thank you for the help	You're very welcome!
I like old school rock.
You are so predictable.
Yeah, my musical tastes are predictably awesome.
What else can you call perfection?
its just what I like.
Alright hold on, I have to find my shoes first.
Really?
You have like three pairs.
How come you're always looking for them?
I always find them right where I left them, I just can't remember where I left them.
Who ate the left overs?
I gave them to the dog.
I was going to eat those!
I'm sorry!
I can make more.
No, it's too late!
Now I have to eat the dogs food.
Hahaha!
You're so funny!
Is it sunny outside?
Actually, it is partly cloudy.
Is it supposed to thunder later?
Yes.
Thunderstorms popping up in the late afternoon, just in time for our drive home.
Great, that should make for some fun traffic.
I hate traffic
By the way, when can I see you again?
Tomorrow night would be wonderful.
I cannot wait until tomorrow.
You're going to have to.
Couldn't we get together tonight?
I have date with someone else tonight, no hard feelings.
Did you do the dishes already?
Yes, they are already clean.
Thanks for saving me some time.
I know you have had a hard day at work today, it's my pleasure.
I'll have to return the favor.
Thanks, but there's no need.
Can I get you a drink?
Yes please, I'd love an iced tea.
Do you want sugar in it or not?
No sugar please.
How about lemon?
If I wanted sugar and lemons in my drink I would have ordered a lemonade.
Just get me the dang iced tea.
Can you repeat what you just said?
Yeah.
What time is it?
It is binge watching time.
Excellent.
What are we watching?
We are watching all 24 seasons of Simpsons!
I love Simpsons.
New York was wonderful.
I really loved the Statue of Liberty.
How can anyone love a statue?
I love how she looks out to the sea.
That sounds ridiculous!
There has to be a better reason	Why should there be a better reason?
It's my reason and that's that!
What are some of the tourist attractions around here?
There is a great beach down the road.
And a National Park.
The history of diving museum is fun but that's a few miles away.
Oh!
I didn't expect to find so much to do around here!
How can I get to the diving museum?
I'm not sure, check a map.
I will take out my handy dandy iPhone and do just that.
Thank You!
I hope you have fun.
Did you change your mind?
Nope I still have to go to the meeting instead.
Dang, do you think you're prepared for that meeting?
Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence dude.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
Just fine?
I need to knock this out of the park.
That sounds like a great idea.
That was sarcasm, why on earth would I want to sit in the sun?
To get a tan?
Yeah, but it's way too hot today.
But isn't that great tanning weather?
I think I saw it in the bedroom on the nightstand.
Good thing we have each other around to keep track of things!
They are all at the movies.
Ah, I see.
What did they go to?
The new batman movie I wanted to see that one.
Well we could go see it together now if you want?
I really like the food here.
I absolutely agree.
I think the food is really yummy.
My favourite is the roast beef open faced sandwich.
What time would you like me to arrive tonight?
Please come at 6pm OK, I will see you then!
Great, and don't forget to bring that special package!
Right!
Carl is going to be so excited to get a puppy for his birthday.
He sure is!
Hey Mike, Barry will be here at 7pm, are you all set and ready to go by the time he gets here?
Oh, do we have to go out with Barry?
Yes, we do.
But he's so weird and oddly obsessive about my dolls.
Only the latex ones.
Is that really a mitigating point?
I used to be years ago.
Not so much anymore.
What kinds of things did you bake?
Mostly muffins and pies.
I love muffins and pies, would you make me one somtime?
Yeah I can do, something sweet or savory?
Are you almost there?
Not even close.
How far away are you?
A couple of miles.
About how long will it take you?
We are running late.
Four minutes.
That is, four minutes after I finish changing the tire.
Can you please fix me a meal?
Yes, I certainly can.
Thank you very much.
What would you like to eat?
I don't know, maybe some pasta!
Sorry, I run out of pasta.
Anything else?
That would be great, do you have space for my case?
Yes, in the passenger seat.
Then that means I have to ride in the back like you're my chauffer.
Do you know how to get to my appointment ?
I will put the address in my GPS.
Don't let it direct you off a bridge.
Did you have a bad experience with a GPS?
If I did drive off a bridge, I wouldn't be here asking.
I've heard some GPS horror stories so you never know!
That is an awfully long time.
Time will fly by, don't worry
Can you give me a ride?
No, not right now maybe later.
But I need a ride now.
You will have to ask someone else.
Fine, thanks for nothing.
You're welcome for nothing!
Could you please help me write a letter?
Sure, I can help you.
What type of letter do you need to write?
It is a letter to my lawyer.
Why are you writing to your lawyer?
I just wanted to thank him for his help.
What did he help you with?
If you plead guilty, we can work a deal.
What do you want from me?
To weigh your choices.
Take the deal and get it over with, or draw this out and take your chances in a trial.
Where is a good place to go camping?
Ask the ranger for a recommendation.
Oh ok, I was hoping you'd have a recommendation.
I don't go camping a lot, actually.
Sorry to bother you.
Not a bother, I'm just not a ranger.
Do you need to get your car out of the garage?
Yes it is time for me to go to work.
I will move my car then.
It is about a mile and a half east of here.
Well hurry, I don't know long I can make it.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Just shut up and speed up!
Okay, okay.
I don't want to get a ticket though!
Yes, I have two little boys.
How old are they?
They are 4 and 1.
Sounds like a handful!
Thankfully they are both pretty mellow.
Did you have that weird dream again last night?
Yeah.
This time it was even weirder though!
What happened in it?
Let's just say the dragon got its wings.
What does that mean?
Exactly as I said the dragon got it wings and did what you'd expect anything else with wings to do which is fly.
Have you ever been to the Louvre?
No, but I would like to.
I would like to go as well.
Maybe one day we will make it.

They're doing great.
What kind of dog do you have again?
A golden retriever.
She's a terror though!
Does she retrieve the wrong things?
She retrieves EVERYTHING!

I forgot to set my alarm to remind me.
No need to shout, I was just asking.

My favorite movie is Casablanca    I haven't seen that one.

The Fellowship of the Ring.
What is your favorite The Lord of the Rings Movie?

We all have our moments.
I did the dishes this morning.
Ok thanks for washing the dishes up, I'll make dinner later.
What is for dinner?
We have pasta or meatloaf, which do you prefer?
I could go for paste.

I'm actually fine.
Weird, let me turn on the fan at least.

That color suits you.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome!
You should wear it more often.
You're looking pretty good yourself.
Aw thank you hun.
I appreciate the compliment as I was debating on wearing this outfit today.
Really, then I don't want to wash your clothes or fix your meals.
That seems fair.
How about you mow the lawn, and i'll worry about feeding and clothing myself.
Would you mind doing the dishes?
Can we put them in the dishwasher?
Dishwasher is out of order, can you do them manually please?
Yes, but if we do it together it would be faster.
I can't right now.

Don't you have a test tomorrow?
Yes, in sociology.
I don't think I'm ready for it.
Did you have enough time to study?
No, I had work so I didn't get home until late.
You didn't get home until late because you were at the bar, remember I saw you!

Are you sure?
That's sort of a bizarre choice.
Yes, trying to stick to my lifestyle aka diet.
You're funny!
One meat burger coming right away!
Can I rest for a little while?
Sure, there's a bench right here.
Ah, thanks.
Now that I'm better rested I will finally stop SHOUTING.

I ran out of my medication and feel really excitable.
SORRY IT BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH!
Oh, it's JUST FINE!
Did the Mets win?
No, they never win     Ha, that is so true  The Yankees, on the other hand, are doing great.
Figures.
Who's your favorite player?
Do you think the Yankees are doing great just because they are the New York fav baseball tea,?
Do you want to come?
No, I think I will pass this time.
Are you mad at me or something?
Nah, just tired of doing the same things all the time.
We could do something different then.
I just wanted to hang out with you for awhile.
What would you like to go do instead.
I want to go rollerskating.
Would you be willing to do that?

I hate that.
I will call it and see if you can hear it.
OK, try it.
Can I have a snack?
Yes, you may have an apple.
An apple and then a piece of cake.
No cake.
It's too close to dinner, and you'll ruin your appetite.
You sound like my mother.
And you eat like your father.
Because my team lost the game	 Do you own the team?
Well no, but I've rooted for them for as long as I can remember.

Is after work a good time?
My last meeting ends at 4:30.
How many doors does it have?
It's a 4 door    Oh, I'm looking for a 2 door model.
But a 4 door will have higher resale value.
That's okay, I'm not really concerned about that.
Oh well, good luck finding what you want.
What do you do for work?
I am a social worker.
Really?
I have thought about going into that field!

You don't have to be a smart aleck.
Sorry, but I only forgot to fill the tank one time and that was years ago!

Does it once, does it all the time.
You're never going to let things go, are you?
Where are you taking me?
I can't tell you that.
It's a surprise!
I hope it's to that new restaurant on 12th.
You will just have to wait to find out.

I ran to the restroom real quick.
I thought you were lost.
No, it just took a while.
Please tell me next time you run off.
Ok, sorry, I will.
Do you every dream about losing your teeth?
I do not.
I had a dream where that happened the other day.
It felt so real.
That must have been really scary!
It's actually really common for people to dream about losing teeth.
I wonder why!
There are many things people dream about that may have meaning in their daily lives as well.
Would you like some toast?
Yes please, thank you!

Now we can both rest easy.

Getting ready for the summer.
Me too.
It's supposed to be a hot one.
Yeah, that's what the weather forecast is showing.
Do you have any advice on the subject?

I can't help you sleep, but some music might.
What kind of music do you think will help?
Listen to some classical.
Can you put on some Chopin?
Sure, how about his Nocturnes?
Can you give me a hand?
I can't lift heavy things, I told you that.
Look, it's not that heavy and you're the only one here.
OK, let me try first.
But if it is too heavy, we'll have to call someone.
Yeah that's fine, we can ask my buff next door neighbor if all else fails!
Can't we just ask him now?
How is your health now?
I am feeling a lot better.
That's good.
Did you have to see the doctor?
No I did not have to.
Did you take any medicine for it?
No, I didn't.
It's those idiots upstairs who never shut up.
We need to move ASAP!
Yeah we do, they are so loud even on weeknights.
Have you confronted them or filed a complaint with the landlord?
Not into confrontation.
I think that might only make it worse.
So where are they really?
They are hiding out back in the shed.

Great, because I didn't want to deal with that situation.
Dont worry, I'll handle them.

I could be ready by noon!
I will see you then!
I look forward to it.
Can you suggest anything on the menu?
I recommend the falafel and spinach burger, a little different, but to die for!
Ok, you order that and I'll have a double coronary with bacon.
Why don't you try the spinach burger with some regular fries?
Because that sounds just disgusting.
And your burger that comes with pre admission papers to the hospital doesn't sound disgusting?
Let's compromise and get a club sandwich.
I guess I should grab my umbrella before we leave.
That would be a good idea.
Ok, let me go grab it.

Are you free this afternoon?
No sorry I have plans.
That's too bad.
How about Friday afternoon we do lunch instead?

Sure here you go	     Thanks, how about a flashlight too?
What exactly are you doing?
It took you awhile to get here, were you busy?
No I just got stuck in some really bad traffic.
I was starting to get worried, glad you made it.
Me too, now I need to unwind.
Yeah, I bet	How do you propose we do that?

No mam, I did not	      What did you end up purchasing?

Once you are doing a bit better yes.

Yes there Is, down the hall.
Thank you very much.
You are very welcome.
Have a nice day!
I hope you do too!
What did you do today?
Work work and more work	Sounds boring, but that's how it went for me as well.

Why do you want to go out with Bob?
He always stiffs you with the bill and doesn't use utensils.
I feel bad telling him no.

It's better to be kind than mean.

Yeah, and you won't get your slippers, though!
What are we having for lunch?
I'm making grilled cheese on wheat, and tomatoe soup.
That's not lunch,that's a appetizer    Then you can make your own lunch!
Ok, I will!
and correct your grammar while you're at it.
Grab any loose change you find.
No problem, I was going to do that anyway.
Also grab anything you find in there.
Can we go to Six Flags?
Six Flags is for chumps.
Real men do it Disney.

Are you sure people don't die at Disney?
People unfortunately have died on Disney rides, haven't you read the media?
Do you have a dog?
Yes, I have 4 dogs	    How much food do you need to buy a week?
More than I buy my family.

NO she got bored of it.
I would think so.

Pretty well, but I had some bad dreams.
That's never fun.
Well yeah, but now that I'm awake I can go on with my day.
No, this is my favorite show Please, I don't want to watch it.
I'll put it on the DVR, but you don't know what you're missing.
It's been a long day.
Maybe I'll watch it with you later.
So what do you want to do in the meantime?
Where is my daughter today?
She's with her grandparents.
What are they doing?
I think they're going to the zoo!
I hope she has fun.

Who is coming today?
Your Dad is coming to visit you.
Is he mad at me?
I don't think he is mad.
Should he be mad at you?
Well last time we talked he seemed kind of short with me.
Everyone seems short with you when you're 6'6.
Ha ha.
Will you help me?
Yes definitely I will help you.
Thanks, can you just hold this right there?
Yes, sure.
I've got it.
Let me know if it gets too heavy for you.

I might plan to take him home with me.
Can you please get me something to eat?
Yes I can get you something now.
Thanks, I just need a snack.
How about some peanuts?
Sure, that sounds great.
Do you like salted, unsalted, or flavoured?
I sure would.
Then I'll go and get some tomorrow.
I am sure you will enjoy the food too.
Who do you want to win the match?
I always root for the underdog.
So who is the underdog here?
For me it has to be the Hawks, they've lost every game this season.
Sounds like a true underdog to me.
I even made a 50 dollar bet on them.
Yes, I noticed we were having trouble.
I saw the neighbor who told me the lines were down when I went to check the mail.
I'll have to call the office tomorrow then.
They are not open tomorrow, it's a holiday.
Duh, I can just use my cell phone.
Oh, that's right!
Is she into dudes?
I don't know her like that.
I hope she is, I am really into her.
Why don't you invite her to the party this weekend?
I would love to, but I'm supposed to bring my girlfriend.
So you have a girlfriend and you're looking at other women?
That sounds great, shall I bring something too?
Not unless you want to.
Well I did buy this nasty new outfit if you'd like to see it.
I would love to.
Not that crappy movie   It's an underrated cult classic!
Right but you watch it at least once a week and quote it all of the time.
It's getting old.
The classics never get old!
About 10 years.
Wow.
Your English is very good.
Thank you, I try really hard to keep improving.
I would like to learn another language as well.
You should!
It takes a while but if you do it every day it's easier.
How could you break it so easily?
It was an accident.
You should be more careful.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
be careful, don't do such thigs again	  I was , it just slipped
It's on, but to hot.
Yes, I agree.
Let's go turn it down a notch.

It was on 75 degrees.
I literally just told not too cold, were you even listening?
What is your house wine?
It's a delicious white wine and we're on the last bottle.
Would you like some?
Yes, please bring me a glass.
I recommend taking the bottle if you like it.
How much is it for the bottle?
Take it as a gift from me.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yes, I will take a cold soda if you have one.
I have soda, would you like to have extra ice cubes?
Just a few in a glass would be fine	      Okay, here you go.
Thank you dear.
When is the movie?
Use your phone, Steve.
Seriously.
Yeah, come on Steve, get your act on.
My cell battery's dead.
Just google the movie theater for me.
Ugh, okay.
First world problems, huh?
Gotta love technology!
My name is Simon.
I was named after the chipmunk.
Simon is the smart one, right?
No, Simon was the dumb one.
Well, he was the funny one too.
Haha!
Why are you doing this?
It makes me happy	     It doesn't really, does it?
No, I'm serious, it actually does.
You enjoy the weirdest things.
Why yes I do

I have to go home and study for the big exam tomorrow.
I think I will do the same!
You want to study together?
Sure!
Sounds like a plan.
Cool, you're so smart!
I can't wait.
Hey where did you get that?
I got it at a thrift store in Austin.
very unique!
I wish I knew where to get one!
They had several in Austin.
You should try there.
But I live in Hong Kong!
They have airplanes, you know.
Have you seen our cat?
I saw him in the garden earlier.
Did he look hungry at all?
No he was busy stalking my dog as we crossed into your yard.
Would you mind if I looked in your yard to see if he is there?
You are already standing in my yard, and there's clearly no cat here.
Can I claim personal injury?
I suppose you can.
My back really hurts from falling off the ladder.
Well maybe you shouldn't climb ladders when you're drunk.
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah, it is a good idea.
Haha.
May I have another?
Yes you may.
Is it okay to give one to Bobby too?
I don't mind at all, but give him the smashed one.
Why not give him the other one that is not smashed?
Because I feel like being mean to him today.
Around what time should I call you next weekend?
Saturday afternoon sounds good.
Alright, I will call you then.
Sure, maybe text me first because I may be running some errands before that.
If I don't respond to your text it may be because I am in the shower.
What if I just call you?
Why is that bill so high?
It's because we had that water leak Yeah, that is right.
Hopefully we can get the leak fixed as soon as possible.
How much will it cost?
A lot.
We'll be living on raman noodles for a while.
Good thing I love raman!
Do you have any big plans for the holiday weekend?
Yes, I'm hoping to go visit friends in Toronto.
How about you?
I plan to go to garage sales.
Are you looking for something special?
Yes, Im looking for a dresser.
I have an antique dresser in my attic you may be interested in.
When do we eat?
We'll be eating shortly.
I'm not really hungry.
Do you want to push back dinner, then?
No, you can go ahead and eat and I will have something a bit later.
okay, i'll have then
How come she gets the larger steak?
Because she paid for the larger steak.
I guess you get what you pay for.
You can say that again.
Next time I should probably order the larger one.
That would be my suggestion.
Do you know what happened to my shirt?
I think the dog ate it	 That must be a joke.
OK, the dog just mauled it.
Your right my shirt is ruined.
Thankfully it wasn't one of your favorites!
How have you been?
Pretty good, you?
Not really.
My mother died last month.
It's so hard on us all right now.
I'm so sorry to hear that!
She had been sick for a while, so it was kind of expected.
My Heartily condolences go to you and your family.
Is the line to the bathroom really long?
yes the line to the bathroom is long like the Disneyland lines.
Oh, then I will just wait until we get home.
Probably your best option.
Then we probably need to leave now since they never have enough stalls for women.
Okay, let's go.
I don't want you to have an accident.
What is wrong with you?
Nothing at all, why?
You were really mean to the new girl.
She's my step-sister!
And she purposely wrecked my shoes last night!
Oh,.well then, of course it's alright to be mean to her then.
Wow, it didn't take much for you to see me point of view.
When do you have to be home?
I need to be home by 11pm.
I think we can manage that.
The movie is over at 10:30.
You think we should bring a blanket?
Yeah I think we should!
Can you bring one?
I don't think I have any at home.
Sure, I will bring the blanket.
I have to go to work.
I meant earlier this morning because I could hear you downstairs coughing.
Oh, that.
I think it was just the fact that the room was light.
If the light wakes you up, you should pull the shades down before you go to sleep every night.
You woke me up moving around and coughing.
I am so sorry about that!
I will be careful next time.
I will get back to you.
Let me think
It's only a buck so cash is all we accept.
Excellent, that's all I have.
Then it works out for both of us!
You want a shortcut to where exactly?
From here to the store on 5th.
The store by the McDonald's on 5th?
Sure.
I just need to get to 5th street mainly.
Make a left at the next light and go straight ahead for one mile.
Thanks.
You are a lifesaver.
When you had the flu you felt better after three days?
No, not that quick.
I felt better after four.
Okay, I hope I feel even better tomorrow then.
Where can I find it?
It's In the kitchen.
Where in the kitchen?
Where would you think the microwave would be in the kitchen?
Well, I would at least think you had a visible microwave, but I still can't see it!
its in the right corner.
It was nice.
You're yelling at me again	 Oops, sorry.
Didn't realize my caps lock was on.
It was nice.
How about yours?
My day was great!
So, what's going on with Robert?
Do you need any other help in setup?
No, you've covered the procedure very well, thanks.
I'm glad you think that, thanks!

Yes, I already have tickets to three.
Wow, you must love music.
Yeah and the amphitheater is only 2 miles from my house.
How much will this cost me?
Just under $100    How much exactly?
It will cost $99.99	  Well that is just under a 100 huh.
NO you get a discount of.01
Yes, I'm going out with friends.

I already have everything ready for supper and we should just eat here.
Do you want something to eat?
Yes, I'm starved.
Me too, let's get pizza!
I know a great pizzeria that is not very far away.
I know which one you're talking about.
I think they're great, too.
Alright!
Let's get going!
Why should I close the window?
You will let in flies.
Maybe i'd rather have the flies, it's so hot in here!
Just remember that when they are crawling on you.
Hey, brilliant idea!
Why don't we buy window screens!
Sounds good!
Let's go to the hardware store right now before it gets any hotter.
What would you like?
I would love a million dollars please.
I'd love to give you that but I can't.
That's a real shame.
I don't think so	  Can I get another wish?
I also like baseball, do you?
No much.
I prefer football		I like football as well!
Baseball does not have enough action to keep me interested.
It's a more cerebral game, that's for sure.
Are you saying I'm stupid?
What do you do?
I stay at home with my children.
Oh, how old are your children?
Two and four, they sure keep me busy.
Sounds like you have your hands full.

When will I get to see you again?
Maybe for the holidays.
That seems so far away.
OK, how about we video chat then?
It's not the same, though.
Can't you come before?
I will try, but I'm not sure I can get the time off work.
Did you plant tomatoes?
No, I don't like tomatoes.
What else did you plant?
Eggplant, squash and cucumbers.
So, any particular reason for your lack of love for tomatoes?
Because they are disgusting pieces of squishy fruit that have no place in a proper salad.
I think so.
Kevin, right?
With a beard?
No, Ralph, very bald, hairless actually.
Oh, so who was the bearded guy I saw you with the other day?
You mean my older brother?
He was visiting from out of town.

What aren't you telling me?
Nothing, I have told you everything I know.
I can tell by your shifty eyes that you're lying!
What are you accusing me of?
You are hiding something from me!
No.
I swear i'm not!
I guess I am.
So, can you lend me one?
I could, but then I would have to worry about when I was going to get it back.

I think I did pretty well too.

I'll bet you a free lunch that I did better than you.
I have many jokes but they aren't appropriate for church.
Is that a joke?
Can we go to the movie, tomorrow?
Sure, as long as you get all your homework done tonight.
Sure!
Do you want to watch an action movie?

No, I asked if it was done, not if you had some.
I will do it later.
You will do it now, or no pudding for you!

Of course, it's in my wallet.
Ok good.
Hopefully they will let us in then.
The line looks really long though.
Are you sure this is the club you want to go to?
Yes, but if you would rather not wait we can go to a different one.
If you don't mind waiting, neither do I.
Where are you from?
I hail from Jamaica.
Weird.
I don't hear any accent.
I went to an American school.
Cool.
Where in Jamaica?
I went to school in the capital.
You're right.

That would be amazing.
Go upstairs, first door on the right.
See you in a bit.
He will be driving before you know it!
I know!
Did you know he wants to start dating already?
That's pretty much what most boys at that age wants to do.
Yeah, but I think it's too soon though.
How are you guys doing?
We are doing fine, thanks for asking.
You're welcome!
You all should come visit sometime!
I'd love that!
When are you free?
My schedule is pretty full but maybe sometime this summer?
Sound good- maybe a Fourth of July party?
Do you think that bugs have souls?
I believe all living things have souls.
I do as well   Demon souls, that is.

Can I give it a try?
No you need a licence.

It was horrible.
Oh no!
Tell me what happened!

I don't think it was a shame.
Now I'm a basketball coach.
Is there something on my back?
It's a spider!
No!
Get it off!
No I don't want to touch it!
Grab that magazine and use it!
YOU grab the magazine and use it yourself!
Where did you go?
Sorry, I just went to run some errands and pick up dinner.
Were you worried?
Yes I was.
I thought you got kidnapped.
Yep, I got kidnapped and now I'm back.
Anyway, ready to eat?
Your cynical remarks will get you nowhere.
Neither will your judgmental assessments.
Are you going to the baby shower?
No, I can't make it.
Why?
Do you have some other important plans?
Actually, I do.
I'm going in for liposuction.
Can't you reschedule that?
No, I'm sorry, I can't.
How can you tell when someone is lying to you?
If they avoid looking in your eyes.
Can you tell if I'm lying to you right now when I say I value your friendship?
I think you're lying for sure.
yeah, you suck as a lie detector	Fine, you are my best friend.
Over in the back corner	That's a potted plant No, there's the bathroom door behind the plant!
You mean I have to go around that plant to get to the bathroom?
That plant's HUGE!
Yes you will need to go around the plant, is that an issue for you?
I will call you in some minutes, okay?
OK, I'll wait for your call.
Talk to you soon.
Hey, so, what's up?
Uh, I was wondering why you couldn't respond by text?
Yes, just a few minutes.
I am starving to death over here!
I seriously doubt that!
I haven't eaten in two days!
Then maybe you should have my lunch too!
Can we go to the park?
what can we do in the park?
Swing and talk like we used to.
That sounds awfully nostalgic, let's get ice cream first like old times.
Oh yes, that sounds nice.
And finally we can end the day by sitting on the porch and yelling at kids to stay off our lawn.
Is there any news yet?
No news yet Will you text me if there is?
As soon as I hear anything.
I am worried if she is alright i will let you know once I hear anything.
did she pee her pants?
I think she must have.
She must be so embarassed.
She doesn't look embarrassed.
Well, she's only two years old!
Been there, done that.
My name is Al.
What's yours?
My name is Maria.
I was named after my grandma.
Who do you think I am named after?
Probably Al Bundy.
Why are you shouting?
because you made me joyfull
At 1:00 pm Is that his usual time?
No, but he got stuck at the office.
Yeah, that happens.
I hate being done late like that.
I don't know   Did you offer to drive her?
No, she's far too mean for me to spend time with her like that.
Then why did you invite her in the first place?
I felt like I had to.
She was standing there when Sandy brought it up.
yes I can      It gave me the blue screen of death after downloading a few games.
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'll try to make that better.
All right, please do.
Were there any messages before the blue screen?
What do you want to do?
I would like to go to the movies.
Awesome!
I'll go bring the car around!
See you soon then!
Think of what you want to watch when we get there.

I'm from Ohio.
How about you?
I am from the state of Arizona.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Perhaps you could relocate?
How much homework do you have?
None.
I'm 42 years old.
What a bizarre question.
I wasn't talking to you.
Go away.
Fine.
No need to be rude.
If you don't like my attitude take a hike	No, you take a hike.
This is my house!
Do you know the hours?
I believe it's open 9-5 during the week.
Do you go there often?
Yeah, I use their computers a lot.
What's your kid been up to lately?
That is none of your business.
No need to be so rude!
I just get tired of people asking.
Better to be asked than for people not to care!
Not when asking becomes conversations I don't care for or have time to have.
What movie was she in?
She was in Gone with the Wind  I knew I recognized her.
Do you know what other movies she was In?
Um, I think maybe that movie about breakfast somewhere.
Are you talking about Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Well, that depends on how you look at it.
Well I love it

He is gone most of the time, he is really busy.

Why don't you call your son?
He won't answer my calls.
And why is that?
Where can I purchase this product?
You can purchase it at home depot.
I always get lost in that store.
Maybe you could ask a sales associate to help you find it then.
That seems to be what always happens to me.
And do they help you?
Sure.
Do you have my number?
I sure do!
I have it saved in my phone.
I thought so.
I hope we can have another date really soon.
I would really like that.
It was cool today.
What were you working on?
Mind your own business.
You must have had a bad day to be so grouchy!
Don't get me started.
Can you do me a favor?
I'll try, what Is It?
Taste this milk and see if it's bad?
No way I'm going to taste that milk!
why don't you like it   I don't like it because you think it might be bad.
Do you want to go grocery shopping?
Yes what time?
whenever is best for you.
How about we leave In 15 minutes?
we can leave in 15 minutes.
Great, see you out front in 15.
That sounds sorta perfect.
You're sorta perfect.
Oh?
Is that where we're going with this?
Is that where you want it to go?
Yes, I can.
Great, Thank you!
Do you have more clothes to wash?
No, just the jumbo load I did earlier.
Ok, then I will start my laundry if you're done.
Did the phone ring?
Yeah it was a wrong number	   Was it the hotline bling?
No some guy with an accent was asking me if my refrigerator was running.
Sure it was.

You can't judge me!
YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER!
I am busy at the moment, can we talk later?
Yeah just call me then.
Is 9.00pm ok?
9:00pm should be fine.
Are your kids in bed at that time?
Yes, they will be fast asleep so don't worry.
I'll keep the ringer off just in case.
Do you know where my keys are?
Yeah, you left them in your jacket pocket.
Oh no, the jacket that just went into the washing machine?
Uh oh.
Yes, that's the one, unfortunately.
Ah, ok.
I will have to fish them out.
They should be fine
Did you receive the check that I sent to you in the mail?
Yes, but I did not appreciate what you wrote in the memo field of the check!
I was just kidding around.
Well I didn't find it funny!
It'll keep you smiling while the check bounces.
Figures, coming from you!
Is there any food left?
A little bit, but we should really go grocery shopping sometime today.
I hate going to the grocery store on a Saturday.
Sometimes we can't avoid that which we hate.
I guess we still need to eat.
Or we could order delivery pizza or Chinese food.
Could you please get me a drink of water?
Sure.
Would you like ice in it?
Oh!
Yes please!
No problem, be right back.
Make sure you use a clean glass!
Are there actually dirty glasses in with the clean dishes?
Did you get the oil changed in the car?
I don't even know how to change the oil, brah.
Yes, it's way overdue!
Where should I take it to have it done?
Take it to the Dodge dealership down the street from us.
They will change it for you.
Ok, thanks for the advice.
Did you drink the last of the milk?
Nope, it wasn't me.
Milk makes me all phlegm-y.
You are really missing something, chocolate milk is the bomb.
Maybe so, but I didn't drink it.
Good more for me then.
I tried chocolate almond milk once, never again!
Do you want to get together for a movie Friday?
I am busy Friday, how about Saturday?
I'm busy Saturday, how about Sunday?
I'm busy Sunday, how about Monday?
I think I will ask someone else out instead seeing as you can't make time for me.
Well that is pretty rude surely we can a good day for both of us.
Have you met my bother?
Yes, we met at the concert last month.
Where was my invitation?

I am going to kick his butt!
He told me you couldn't come!

You're welcome.
Help yourself.
Can I get a straw somewhere?

No thanks.
I'm on a diet.
We can eat some salad instead.
Thats okay I brought food from home, maybe next time though.
Okay, suit yourself	How about a rain check for tommorow?
Does your daughter like vegetables?
Yes she does like them.
I wish it were so easy with mine.
I have to trick her into eating them.
She might grow out of that.
I sure hope so, it would make things easier.
Their palettes change every seven years!
Did you speak to the doctor?
Yes I did, thank you.
And what did he tell you to do?
Actually, my doctor's a woman.
She said I should work on my posture and exercise.
Oh that's good to know, at least it's not something that requires extensive treatment.
Well, I might also need physiotherapy, which can get expensive.
How is your wife doing after her surgery?
She's doing okay       Is there anything I can do to help?
I could really use help picking up the kids from school so my wife isn't home alone.
No problem!

My house, my rules!

As long as I find it hot and in my favorite mug.
I don't know, let me check the news.
Check the homepage, it's bookmarked there.
If you have it bookmarked, why not check yourself?
Because, you're sitting nearer to my computer.
The computer is literally two inches from your hand.
You're just being lazy, Tony.
How much does this cost?
too much money	 What do you think would be a reasonable cost?
About half what they're currently charging, I think.
Do you think you could dicker it down?
I didn't go to law school for nothing.
Can we go out dancing?
Yes I have to get dressed first.
I want to dance the salsa.
That's fine, but you still need to put on pants first.
Maybe I'll invent a new dance that I dont need pants for!
I think there is a dance out there like that already.
Could you please get something out of my purse for me?
Sure.
What do you need?
The beef jerky stick please.
I don't see it in here.
Am I missing something?
Two eyeball and a brain by the sound of it.
You don't have to be rude!
Okay, call me next time you're going to be late.

All right.
So, see you back when?
First thing tomorrow morning, sounds good?
Do you have a restroom I could use?
Restrooms are for customers only.
I really need to go.

I'm sorry sir, but according to our policy you must buy something in order to use the restroom.
Ill buy a pack of gum then.
I can't believe I have to buy gum to use your restroom.

Any of the national parks are great.
Which one is your favorite?
I like Yellowstone.

You lose all the contests you never join!
OK, please don't yell at me.
I'm not yelling.
I'm just excited.
What's it doing under the couch?
The kids were playing dress up and hid it there.
You let the kids play with my hat?

Do you need me to get some bananas for you at the grocery store?
No thank you.
I believe that we already have bananas in the house.
What have your tried?
I tried everything I could think of.
Ok, well you've got to be more specific than that.
What have you tried?
I tried sending an email, calling, texting and I drove over to his house.
Maybe you should leave a note on his car.
I don't want to seem like a total stalker.
You're welcome.
Do you want another one?
It appears a man has died.
Has someone already called the police?
Yes, the police and ambulance arrived about 10 minutes ago.
Is foul play suspected?
I don't think so.
Whose got the dill pickles?

Sure thing, no problem.
Should I stock up on dill pickles for the future?

Our refrigerator is broken and I have no ice.
Is cold from the tap OK?
Nah, I'll just go to Taco Bell and get some.

yes, and I'm not happy about it.
Me neither, but I am glad we leave first thing in the morning.
I suppose.
Is the airline putting us up in a hotel for a night?
A dingy hotel on the other side of town was what I was told.
Sounds about right.
Can you please get me my phone?
Sure, here it is.
I didn't want it back broken.
I didn't realize I had broken it.
The screen wasn't cracked when I loaned it to you.
It was not intentional, I'm sorry
Do you think driving your car causes climate change?
I think it contributes to global warming.
I agree with you!
What do you think we should do about it?
Make a commitment to use public transportation at least three days a week.
It isn't much but it is a start.
But doesn't public transportation add to the problem as well?
How come you don't get fat eating all of this?
Lucky metabolism, I guess.
My metabolism is so slow that when I look at a piece of cake, I gain 5 pounds.
That sounds awful, I would hate to feel that way!
That's why I never look at fatty foods!
You must, because you're still fat!
Could you please open this for me?
Yes I can.
Thank you very much, you must be strong!
Thanks, I work out.
Are you a member of a gym?
Yes I go every day.
What did you do last weekend?

The same yard you mowed?
Dude, you probably ripped them all up again!
Um, I mowed around them.
Why is it so hot today?
Because there is a heat wave.
Did you go outside?
It is a scorcher!
We really need to get our air conditioning fixed, can you call the repairman?
Sure I will get that done right away.
I sure hope they can come quickly, before we melt!
Do you know her?
no, we never met	     Then why does she tell me you're dating?
She said what?
To whom?
Dude she has been telling everybody!
That girl is seriously crazy!
Hello, where is a good place to eat?
Try the steak house on the corner.
Okay, do they know how to cook a steak?
I would assume so, since they do good business.
Good to know, thanks.
your welcome dear.
Yes, I will give it to you.
Thank you so much.
Actually, I am going downtown.
Do you need a ride?
I would love one.
What are you going downtown for?
I need some supplies.
No.
Football is like brain cancer.
What do you mean when you say it's like brain cancer?
I mean it's a waste of time that saps your energy needlessly.
Football is life!
How can you say that!
Football isn't life.
If it is your life, you need to get a new one.
Have you seen this?
No, what Is It?
I'm not sure, it looks like some kind of worm doesn't it?
It's pretty gross.
Do you think we should capture it for the zoo?
I don't think they would be interested in such creature.
Did she call you yet?
She hasn't called yet, but she did send a text a few minutes ago.
What did she say?
She said she was held up at work.
That's too bad.
I'm going to call her tonight.
Indeed!
it does.
Do you have the time?
For you, yes.
Aw, that's so sweet of you!
Thanks, it's 2:15.
I can't believe how late it is.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Do you come to school by bus?
No I walked today      Makes sense, it's so nice out today.
Are you going to be able to make it home on time?
I hope so, lets see what time I get out of here.
I can get my mom to give you a lift if you want?
We'll have some rice and beans too.
That sounds delicious.
I'm glad you think so!
Have you been taking your meds?
Mind your own business for once!
As soon as this month is finished I am moving out and finding a new roommate.
I am sick and tired of you!
I was just trying to be nice since you look sick.
If you want to be nice then ask how you can help.
I'm sorry; I didn't mean to upset you.
But you don't usually want any help.
Sorry.
I'm grouchy today, bro.
Yes, what do you need?
This math problem is really stumping me up.
Ok, let's go through it step by step to see where your problem is.
Oh wait, I see what I was missing.
Thanks for you help.
No worries.
Anytime you need.
How did you like the movie?
It was great.
Great like the Lion King was great, or Great like Captain America level great?
First of all, the Lion King is way better than Captain America, but it was only Wedding Crashers great.
That's not very great in my book.
What was wrong with Wedding Crashers?
WHat do you do?
I work as a window-cleaner.
Do you have to go up to tall buildings?
Sometimes.
And yes, it is a bit scary.
I'm terrified of heights.
Wow, the things we do for money.
Yeah, a guy's gotta eat.
Is there any extra credit?
On this particular class, no there is not.
Oh my, looks like I will need a tutor.
I can tutor you.
That would be wonderful!
When would you like to start?
Could you please call my attorney for me?
If you can give me his number I will.
Yes, one second let me just look it up.
Have you found the number yet?
I'm looking for it now.
Ok I will wait.
It may be awesome but frying it basically takes all of the vegetable out of it!
I eat for taste, it tastes great.
How much did that cost?
About three fifty.
Wow, that is a good deal.
You're telling me, it was quite a steal.
Where did you get it?
I bought it online through Amazon.
How is school going?
It's going well!
Have you made a lot of new friends?
No, everyone hates me.
What makes you think everyone hates you?
They keep saying I hate you when they pass me in the hallway.
What kind of flowers do you prefer?
I like orchids, remember!
Oh I thought you liked lilacs, weird.
Why would you think that?
I could have sworn I head you say it once	Come to think of it, I might have said that quite a while back.
Can you try that one more time?
yes but it's the last time   Why?
If you loved me you would try, try, again.
Maybe we aren't right for each other anymore.
Well screw you then.
Excuse me.
You have no right to speak to me like that.
If you are willing to let go this easily instead of working out our issue then maybe you are right, maybe we just aren't meant for each other.
What is the weather today?
It's sunny and hot.
What will it be like tomorrow?
Tomorrow will be rainy, which makes me really sad!
Why sad?
I love the rain!
i was planning for a ride.
Will you pour me some water?
Absolutely, I'd love to do that for you.
Thanks, while you are at it, fix me a sandwich too.
Any thing else your highness?
Not right now, but I'm sure I'll think of something later.
Well, please don't hesitate to ring the bell if you do.
Will you be visiting me again tomorrow?
For the last time, Princess, no.
The dragon will keep you company.
The dragon sucks at poker, though.
Come on, it's great at Backgammon!
Yeah but he insists we play poker.
Well ask the Ogre to play.
Where are you man?
I'm on the bus.
Where are you heading?
I'm going to Reno.
Why in the world are you going to Reno?
the question is why are you not going to Reno?
Can you inform Sarah and ask her to visit me?
I will ask her to visit you.
I need you to inform her also, don't forget about it.
I won't forget, don't worry.
Ok, please don't and I just need to say inform again, it's my word of the day.
Thank you for informing me.
Have you seen him today?
No I saw no sign of him.
I have a message for him and I don't know when he will be back.
Ok, well put a note on his desk then.
Okay, I'll tape it to his computer screen.
I am sure he will be in shortly, he's rarely ever this late.
What's the weather going to be tomorrow?
Sunny at morning, but rainy at night Perfect, I love nighttime storms.
I would like them more if they didn't scare my dog.
Just get a different dog then.
A dog isn't like a blender.
How long until the game starts?
I think it'll be another half hour   Great.
I think it'll be a good game today.
I think so too with everything that has been going on with the team lately.
I hope Suarez recovers soon, they still need him.
he will be available from next game.
I really like french toast or danish.
I'm not too hot on that, personally.
Well what breakfast foods do you prefer?
I prefer bacon and eggs.
Okay, let's have omelettes then, I like bacon and eggs as well.

Well, do you have fifty cents?
Let me go check in my bag.
Give me as soon as you find.
How are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
A little tired, but otherwise fine.
Oh no, why are you feeling tired?
I have had trouble sleeping lately due to leg cramps.
Make sure to hydrate properly and get exercise.
I've heard eating bananas and drinking milk helps too, because of the potassium and calcium.
Are you cooking tonight?
Yes every night this week.
Do you love cooking?
