Sit me up
I feel short of breath
I have pain in the neck
I am too hot
I am too cold
I have cramp
My bedsheets are uncomfortable
How wonderful to see you
How glorious to see you
How fantastic to see you
How superb to see you
Ah, how lovely to see you
Hello darling
Hello sweetheart
Hello, great to see you!
I'm absolutely wonderful
I feel excellent.
I am doing good
I'm fine
I'm OK
I don't feel brilliant
I'm not at my best
I feel awful
I'm utterly miserable
I feel horrible
I feel awesome
I am tired
I'm great
Have a wonderful day
Have a lovely day
Have a glorious day
Bye
Goodbye my darling!
My shirt is uncomfortable
I want a hug
Give me a kiss
Touch me!
Reach out and touch me!
Come hold my hand
Helloo! Anybody there?
Hey is anyone there?
