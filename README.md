## Official release of ACAT 2.0 is now available [here](https://github.com/intel/acat/releases)
### This release includes:
- Enhanced language models that are specifically fine-tuned for [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication) with word and sentence predictions to improve typing efficiency and provide a personalized user experience
- Multiple typing modes for faster communication
- Revamped and modernized user interface design
- Wizard-based user onboarding
- Modular software architecture for easier extensibility

## Background
The Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open-source platform created at Intel Labs. It is designed to enhance communication for individuals with restricted speech and typing capabilities. It achieves this by providing functionalities like keyboard simulation, word/sentence prediction, and speech synthesis.

ACAT was originally developed by researchers in Intel Labs for Professor Stephen Hawking. He was instrumental to the design process and was a key contributor to the project design and validation. After deploying the system to Professor Hawking, Intel turned its attention to the larger community and continued to make ACAT more configurable to support a larger set of users.

By making this configurable platform open source, the goal is to encourage developers  to continue to expanding its capabilities by adding new user interfaces, new sensing modalities, language prediction, and other features.

ACAT is developed in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio* 2022 and .NET 4.8.1. It runs on WindowsÂ® 10 (20H2 or higher) and 11.
